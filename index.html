                                        <span>  In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework
enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the
advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a
performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We
try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance
and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual
tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,
we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution
refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a
high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and
reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In
general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current
frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.
Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)
from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several
zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MiniGemini.

                                        <span>  The rise of Modular Deep Learning showcases its potential in various Natural
Language Processing applications. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
modularity has been shown to work for various use cases, from domain adaptation
to multilingual setups. However, all this work covers the case where the
modular components are trained and deployed within one single Pre-trained
Language Model (PLM). This model-specific setup is a substantial limitation on
the very modularity that modular architectures are trying to achieve. We ask
whether current modular approaches are transferable between models and whether
we can transfer the modules from more robust and larger PLMs to smaller ones.
In this work, we aim to fill this gap via a lens of Knowledge Distillation,
commonly used for model compression, and present an extremely straightforward
approach to transferring pre-trained, task-specific PEFT modules between
same-family PLMs. Moreover, we propose a method that allows the transfer of
modules between incompatible PLMs without any change in the inference
complexity. The experiments on Named Entity Recognition, Natural Language
Inference, and Paraphrase Identification tasks over multiple languages and PEFT
methods showcase the initial potential of transferable modularity.

                                        <span>  Mitigation of gender bias in NLP has a long history tied to debiasing static
word embeddings. More recently, attention has shifted to debiasing pre-trained
language models. We study to what extent the simplest projective debiasing
methods, developed for word embeddings, can help when applied to BERT's
internal representations. Projective methods are fast to implement, use a small
number of saved parameters, and make no updates to the existing model
parameters. We evaluate the efficacy of the methods in reducing both intrinsic
bias, as measured by BERT's next sentence prediction task, and in mitigating
observed bias in a downstream setting when fine-tuned. To this end, we also
provide a critical analysis of a popular gender-bias assessment test for
quantifying intrinsic bias, resulting in an enhanced test set and new bias
measures. We find that projective methods can be effective at both intrinsic
bias and downstream bias mitigation, but that the two outcomes are not
necessarily correlated. This finding serves as a warning that intrinsic bias
test sets, based either on language modeling tasks or next sentence prediction,
should not be the only benchmark in developing a debiased language model.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual
errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To
benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to
generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38
topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for
long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality
Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into
a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a
multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search
and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore,
we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.
To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response
(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter
representing a user's preferred response length (recall).
  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating
performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced
human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement
cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times
cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on
LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding
that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality.
LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at

generally language-, region-, and in some cases, device-dependent, which
increases the effort to scale and maintain them. Combining NNLMs for one or
more of the categories is one way to improve scalability. In this work, we
combine regional variants of English to build a ``World English'' NNLM for
on-device VAs. In particular, we investigate the application of adapter
bottlenecks to model dialect-specific characteristics in our existing
production NNLMs {and enhance the multi-dialect baselines}. We find that
adapter modules are more effective in modeling dialects than specializing
entire sub-networks. Based on this insight and leveraging the design of our
production models, we introduce a new architecture for World English NNLM that
meets the accuracy, latency, and memory constraints of our single-dialect
models.

                                        <span>  We introduce CheckEval, a novel evaluation framework using Large Language
Models, addressing the challenges of ambiguity and inconsistency in current
evaluation methods. CheckEval addresses these challenges by dividing evaluation
criteria into detailed sub-aspects and constructing a checklist of Boolean
questions for each, simplifying the evaluation. This approach not only renders
the process more interpretable but also significantly enhances the robustness
and reliability of results by focusing on specific evaluation dimensions.
Validated through a focused case study using the SummEval benchmark, CheckEval
indicates a strong correlation with human judgments. Furthermore, it
demonstrates a highly consistent Inter-Annotator Agreement. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of CheckEval for objective, flexible, and precise
evaluations. By offering a customizable and interactive framework, CheckEval
sets a new standard for the use of LLMs in evaluation, responding to the
evolving needs of the field and establishing a clear method for future
LLM-based evaluation.

                                        <span>  Protolanguage reconstruction is central to historical linguistics. The
comparative method, one of the most influential theoretical and methodological
frameworks in the history of the language sciences, allows linguists to infer
protoforms (reconstructed ancestral words) from their reflexes (related modern
words) based on the assumption of regular sound change. Not surprisingly,
numerous computational linguists have attempted to operationalize comparative
reconstruction through various computational models, the most successful of
which have been supervised encoder-decoder models, which treat the problem of
predicting protoforms given sets of reflexes as a sequence-to-sequence problem.
We argue that this framework ignores one of the most important aspects of the
comparative method: not only should protoforms be inferable from cognate sets
(sets of related reflexes) but the reflexes should also be inferable from the
protoforms. Leveraging another line of research -- reflex prediction -- we
propose a system in which candidate protoforms from a reconstruction model are
reranked by a reflex prediction model. We show that this more complete
implementation of the comparative method allows us to surpass state-of-the-art
protoform reconstruction methods on three of four Chinese and Romance datasets.

generation and improved the programming efficiency of human developers.
However, their self-refinement capability is typically overlooked by the
existing evaluations of code LMs, which focus only on the accuracy of the
one-time prediction. For the cases when code LMs fail to implement the correct
program, developers actually find it hard to debug and fix the faulty
prediction since it is not written by the developers themselves. Unfortunately,
our study reveals that code LMs cannot efficiently self-refine their faulty
generations as well.
  In this paper, we propose CYCLE framework, learning to self-refine the faulty
generation according to the available feedback, such as the execution results
reported by the test suites. We evaluate CYCLE on three popular code generation
benchmarks, HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS. The results reveal that CYCLE
successfully maintains, sometimes improves, the quality of one-time code
generation, while significantly improving the self-refinement capability of
code LMs. We implement four variants of CYCLE with varied numbers of parameters
across 350M, 1B, 2B, and 3B, and the experiments show that CYCLE consistently
boosts the code generation performance, by up to 63.5%, across benchmarks and
varied model sizes. We also notice that CYCLE outperforms code LMs that have
3$\times$ more parameters in self-refinement.

                                        <span>  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating
contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their
application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered
by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately
represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces
the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to
reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our
observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate
hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from
standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty
and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original
distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks
(POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that
ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level
hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of
LVLMs.

results in a lower number of available benchmarks to evaluate the performance
of language models in Italian.
  This work presents two new benchmarks to evaluate the models performance on
mathematical understanding and language understanding in Italian. These
benchmarks are based on real tests that are undertaken by students of age
between 11 and 18 within the Italian school system and have therefore been
validated by several experts in didactics and pedagogy.
  To validate this dataset we evaluate the performance of 9 language models
that are the best performing when writing in Italian, including our own
fine-tuned models. We show that this is a challenging benchmark where current
language models are bound by 60\% accuracy.
  We believe that the release of this dataset paves the way for improving
future models mathematical and language understanding in Italian.

of tasks, particularly in language generation. Previous studies have found that
the performance of neural models frequently adheres to predictable scaling
laws, correlated with factors such as training set size and model size. This
insight is invaluable, especially as large-scale experiments grow increasingly
resource-intensive. Yet, such scaling law has not been fully explored in dense
retrieval due to the discrete nature of retrieval metrics and complex
relationships between training data and model sizes in retrieval tasks. In this
study, we investigate whether the performance of dense retrieval models follows
the scaling law as other neural models. We propose to use contrastive
log-likelihood as the evaluation metric and conduct extensive experiments with
dense retrieval models implemented with different numbers of parameters and
trained with different amounts of annotated data. Results indicate that, under
our settings, the performance of dense retrieval models follows a precise
power-law scaling related to the model size and the number of annotations.
Additionally, we examine scaling with prevalent data augmentation methods to
assess the impact of annotation quality, and apply the scaling law to find the
best resource allocation strategy under a budget constraint. We believe that
these insights will significantly contribute to understanding the scaling
effect of dense retrieval models and offer meaningful guidance for future
research endeavors.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLM) are prone to returning false information. It
constitutes one of major challenges in the AI field. In our work, we explore
paradigm introduced by Inference-Time-Intervention (ITI). In first stage, it
identifies attention heads, which contain the highest amount of desired type of
knowledge (e.g., truthful). Afterwards, during inference, LLM activations are
shifted for chosen subset of attention heads. We further improved the ITI
framework by introducing a nonlinear probing and multi-token intervention -
Non-Linear ITI (NL-ITI). NL-ITI is tested on diverse multiple-choice
benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, on which we report around 14% MC1 metric
improvement with respect to the baseline ITI results. NL-ITI achieves also
encouraging results on other testsets - on Business Ethics subdomain of MMLU,
around 18% MC1 improvement over baseline LLaMA2-7B. Additionally, NL-ITI
performs better while being less invasive in the behavior of LLM at the same
time (as measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence).

                                        <span>  Evaluating the veracity of everyday claims is time consuming and in some
cases requires domain expertise. We empirically demonstrate that the commonly
used fact checking pipeline, known as the retriever-reader, suffers from
performance deterioration when it is trained on the labeled data from one
domain and used in another domain. Afterwards, we delve into each component of
the pipeline and propose novel algorithms to address this problem. We propose
an adversarial algorithm to make the retriever component robust against
distribution shift. Our core idea is to initially train a bi-encoder on the
labeled source data, and then, to adversarially train two separate document and
claim encoders using unlabeled target data. We then focus on the reader
component and propose to train it such that it is insensitive towards the order
of claims and evidence documents. Our empirical evaluations support the
hypothesis that such a reader shows a higher robustness against distribution
shift. To our knowledge, there is no publicly available multi-topic fact
checking dataset. Thus, we propose a simple automatic method to re-purpose two
well-known fact checking datasets. We then construct eight fact checking
scenarios from these datasets, and compare our model to a set of strong
baseline models, including recent domain adaptation models that use GPT4 for
generating synthetic data.

diversity in recommendation systems is both crucial and demanding. Many current
solutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both
item-based and user-item collaborative signals. A common trend in these
approaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating
model complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is
essential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse,
rather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as
Click-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task
learning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions. We apply
item-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and
negative pairs based on item metadata. Our approach allows the model to better
understand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by
utilizing semantic information from text. It leads to more accurate, relevant,
and diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start
users who have few interactions with items. We perform extensive experiments on
two widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our
findings demonstrate that jointly training user-item interactions and
item-based signals using synopsis text is highly effective. Furthermore, our
results provide evidence that item-based contrastive learning enhances the
quality of entity embeddings, as indicated by metrics such as uniformity and
alignment.

Speculative Decoding with Semantic Adaptive Tokens (SDSAT). The primary
objective of this design is to enhance the LLM model's ability to generate
draft tokens more accurately without compromising the model's accuracy. The
core strategies involve: 1) Fine-tune the model by incorporating semantic
adaptive tokens that possess flexible decoding capabilities without changing
its structure, allowing them to generate high-quality draft tokens. 2) By
employing a training method that does not affect the standard tokens, the model
can acquire parallel decoding abilities atop its original framework with
minimal training overhead. 3) We have designed the "two-step-draft-then-verify"
generation strategies using both greedy search and nucleus sampling.
Experiments conducted on the CodeLlama-13B and 7B models have yielded speed
increases of over 3.5X and 3.0X, respectively. Please refer to

                                        <span>  In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and
vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting
vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing
vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accuracy, and
high duplication rates, leading to unreliable model performance in realistic
vulnerability detection scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation methods used
with these datasets are not representative of real-world vulnerability
detection.
  To address these challenges, we introduce PrimeVul, a new dataset for
training and evaluating code LMs for vulnerability detection. PrimeVul
incorporates a novel set of data labeling techniques that achieve comparable
label accuracy to human-verified benchmarks while significantly expanding the
dataset. It also implements a rigorous data de-duplication and chronological
data splitting strategy to mitigate data leakage issues, alongside introducing
more realistic evaluation metrics and settings. This comprehensive approach
aims to provide a more accurate assessment of code LMs' performance in
real-world conditions.
  Evaluating code LMs on PrimeVul reveals that existing benchmarks
significantly overestimate the performance of these models. For instance, a
state-of-the-art 7B model scored 68.26% F1 on BigVul but only 3.09% F1 on
PrimeVul. Attempts to improve performance through advanced training techniques
and larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were unsuccessful, with results akin
to random guessing in the most stringent settings. These findings underscore
the considerable gap between current capabilities and the practical
requirements for deploying code LMs in security roles, highlighting the need
for more innovative research in this domain.

networks with certain brain-like properties. In the past few decades, this
model has received increasing attention in computer science community, owing
also to the successful phenomenon of deep learning. In SNN, communication
between neurons takes place through the spikes and spike trains. This
differentiates these models from the ``standard'' artificial neural networks
(ANN) where the frequency of spikes is replaced by real-valued signals. Spiking
neural P systems (SNPS) can be considered a branch of SNN based more on the
principles of formal automata, with many variants developed within the
framework of the membrane computing theory. In this paper, we first briefly
compare structure and function, advantages and drawbacks of SNN and SNPS. A key
part of the article is a survey of recent results and applications of machine
learning and deep learning models of both SNN and SNPS formalisms.

                                        <span>  Over the last years, various sentence embedders have been an integral part in
the success of current machine learning approaches to Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Unfortunately, multiple sources have shown that the bias,
inherent in the datasets upon which these embedding methods are trained, is
learned by them. A variety of different approaches to remove biases in
embeddings exists in the literature. Most of these approaches are applicable to
word embeddings and in fewer cases to sentence embeddings. It is problematic
that most debiasing approaches are directly transferred from word embeddings,
therefore these approaches fail to take into account the nonlinear nature of
sentence embedders and the embeddings they produce. It has been shown in
literature that bias information is still present if sentence embeddings are
debiased using such methods. In this contribution, we explore an approach to
remove linear and nonlinear bias information for NLP solutions, without
impacting downstream performance. We compare our approach to common debiasing
methods on classical bias metrics and on bias metrics which take nonlinear
information into account.

                                        <span>  In recent years, several influential computational models and metrics have
been proposed to predict how humans comprehend and process sentence. One
particularly promising approach is contextual semantic similarity. Inspired by
the attention algorithm in Transformer and human memory mechanisms, this study
proposes an ``attention-aware'' approach for computing contextual semantic
relevance. This new approach takes into account the different contributions of
contextual parts and the expectation effect, allowing it to incorporate
contextual information fully. The attention-aware approach also facilitates the
simulation of existing reading models and evaluate them. The resulting
``attention-aware'' metrics of semantic relevance can more accurately predict
fixation durations in Chinese reading tasks recorded in an eye-tracking corpus
than those calculated by existing approaches. The study's findings further
provide strong support for the presence of semantic preview benefits in Chinese
naturalistic reading. Furthermore, the attention-aware metrics of semantic
relevance, being memory-based, possess high interpretability from both
linguistic and cognitive standpoints, making them a valuable computational tool
for modeling eye-movements in reading and further gaining insight into the
process of language comprehension. Our approach underscores the potential of
these metrics to advance our comprehension of how humans understand and process
language, ultimately leading to a better understanding of language
comprehension and processing.

be achieved in one of two ways. It can be achieved either by imposing
constraints on AI actors such as developers, deployers and users, and on AI
resources such as data, or by imposing constraints on the range and scope of
the impact that AI agents can have on the environment. The latter approach
involves encoding extant rules concerning AI driven devices into the software
of AI agents controlling those devices (e.g., encoding rules about limitations
on zones of operations into the agent software of an autonomous drone device).
This is a challenge since the effectivity of such an approach requires a method
of extracting, loading, transforming and computing legal information that would
be both explainable and legally interoperable, and that would enable AI agents
to reason about the law. In this paper, we sketch a proof of principle for such
a method using large language models (LLMs), expert legal systems known as
legal decision paths, and Bayesian networks. We then show how the proposed
method could be applied to extant regulation in matters of autonomous cars,
such as the California Vehicle Code.

Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution
shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this
capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type
of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and
study whether such models can successfully classify those images into
composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset
called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely
encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large
datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude
improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both
supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and
YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training
data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional
generalization abilities of vision-language models.

and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language
foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal
Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort
of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression
models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,
we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first
transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural
language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are
converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text
information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data
are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language
model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning
high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between
pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We
then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the
tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to
capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.
Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of
the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely
prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both
deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the
language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and
outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Code is publicly

                                        <span>  Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using pre-trained language
models for legal case retrieval. Most of the existing works focus on improving
the representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token
and calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the
legal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases
are relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the
similarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper
treatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be
limited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To
this end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case
retrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and
pulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts
while pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding
space in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word
alignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage
shallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the
representation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable
translation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key
facts to enhance discriminative ability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on
publicly available legal benchmarks show that our approach can outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods in legal case retrieval. It provides a new
perspective on the in-depth understanding and processing of legal case

While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations
between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify
their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax.
Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS)
extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an
information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes
the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time
compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then
established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions.
Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well
known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct
morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation
between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the
influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.

                                        <span>  Nowadays, individuals tend to engage in dialogues with Large Language Models,
seeking answers to their questions. In times when such answers are readily
accessible to anyone, the stimulation and preservation of human's cognitive
abilities, as well as the assurance of maintaining good reasoning skills by
humans becomes crucial. This study addresses such needs by proposing hints
(instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution. We
introduce a framework for the automatic hint generation for factoid questions,
employing it to construct TriviaHG, a novel large-scale dataset featuring
160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions from the TriviaQA dataset.
Additionally, we present an automatic evaluation method that measures the
Convergence and Familiarity quality attributes of hints. To evaluate the
TriviaHG dataset and the proposed evaluation method, we enlisted 10 individuals
to annotate 2,791 hints and tasked 6 humans with answering questions using the
provided hints. The effectiveness of hints varied, with success rates of 96%,
78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively.
Moreover, the proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a robust correlation
with annotators' results. Conclusively, the findings highlight three key
insights: the facilitative role of hints in resolving unknown questions, the
dependence of hint quality on answer difficulty, and the feasibility of
employing automatic evaluation methods for hint assessment.

                                        <span>  Language models (LMs) are indispensable tools for natural language processing
tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a concern. While
current research has explored adversarial training techniques, their
improvements to defend against word-level attacks have been limited. In this
work, we propose a novel approach called Semantic Robust Defence (SemRoDe), a
Macro Adversarial Training strategy to enhance the robustness of LMs. Drawing
inspiration from recent studies in the image domain, we investigate and later
confirm that in a discrete data setting such as language, adversarial samples
generated via word substitutions do indeed belong to an adversarial domain
exhibiting a high Wasserstein distance from the base domain. Our method learns
a robust representation that bridges these two domains. We hypothesize that if
samples were not projected into an adversarial domain, but instead to a domain
with minimal shift, it would improve attack robustness. We align the domains by
incorporating a new distance-based objective. With this, our model is able to
learn more generalized representations by aligning the model's high-level
output features and therefore better handling unseen adversarial samples. This
method can be generalized across word embeddings, even when they share minimal
overlap at both vocabulary and word-substitution levels. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on BERT and RoBERTa
models on three datasets. The results demonstrate promising state-of-the-art
robustness.

on a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks. However, these models have hundreds
of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users
to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data
sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question,
we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive
model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. When
fine-tuned, BioMedLM can produce strong multiple-choice biomedical
question-answering results competitive with much larger models, such as
achieving a score of 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on the MMLU Medical
Genetics exam. BioMedLM can also be fine-tuned to produce useful answers to
patient questions on medical topics. This demonstrates that smaller models can
potentially serve as transparent, privacy-preserving, economical and
environmentally friendly foundations for particular NLP applications, such as
in biomedicine. The model is available on the Hugging Face Hub:

                                        <span>  Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large
Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality
have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models
(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect
advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has
surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and
LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce
a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is
utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a
series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence
of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with
the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a
single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The
resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while
maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal
information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach
enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without
necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis
across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five
open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image
Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out
of ten benchmarks.

Recent works aim to reduce misinformation and hallucinations by resorting to
attribution as a means to provide evidence (i.e., citations). However, current
attribution methods usually focus on the retrieval stage and automatic
evaluation that neglect mirroring the citation mechanisms in human scholarly
writing to bolster credibility. In this paper, we address these challenges by
modelling the attribution task as preference learning and introducing an
Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework. First, we create a curated
collection for post-training with 6,330 examples by collecting and filtering
from existing datasets. Second, considering the high cost of labelling
preference data, we further propose an automatic method to synthesize
attribution preference data resulting in 95,263 pairs. Moreover, inspired by
the human citation process, we further propose a progressive preference
optimization method by leveraging fine-grained information. Extensive
experiments on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5) demonstrate
that APO achieves state-of-the-art citation F1 with higher answer quality.

of addressing a diverse range of tasks. However, general LLMs, which are
developed on open-domain data, may lack the domain-specific knowledge essential
for tasks in vertical domains, such as legal, medical, etc. To address this
issue, previous approaches either conduct continuous pre-training with
domain-specific data or employ retrieval augmentation to support general LLMs.
Unfortunately, these strategies are either cost-intensive or unreliable in
practical applications. To this end, we present a novel framework named BLADE,
which enhances Black-box LArge language models with small Domain-spEcific
models. BLADE consists of a black-box LLM and a small domain-specific LM. The
small LM preserves domain-specific knowledge and offers specialized insights,
while the general LLM contributes robust language comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, our method involves three steps: 1) pre-training
the small LM with domain-specific data, 2) fine-tuning this model using
knowledge instruction data, and 3) joint Bayesian optimization of the general
LLM and the small LM. Extensive experiments conducted on public legal and
medical benchmarks reveal that BLADE significantly outperforms existing
approaches. This shows the potential of BLADE as an effective and
cost-efficient solution in adapting general LLMs for vertical domains.

forth the concept of semantic similarity, which has proven immensely beneficial
in multiple applications and has largely replaced keyword search. However,
evaluating semantic similarity and conducting searches for a specific query

due to the multifaceted nature of the task, the lack of standard benchmarks,

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate erroneous outputs, known as
hallucinations, due to their limitations in discerning questions beyond their
knowledge scope. While addressing hallucination has been a focal point in
research, previous efforts primarily concentrate on enhancing correctness
without giving due consideration to the significance of rejection mechanisms.
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the role of rejection,
introducing the notion of model reliability along with corresponding metrics.
These metrics measure the model's ability to provide accurate responses while
adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby
minimizing hallucinations. To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we
present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from
Knowledge Feedback (RLKF). RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to dynamically
determine the model's knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to
encourage the refusal of out-of-knowledge questions. Experimental results on
mathematical questions affirm the substantial efficacy of RLKF in significantly
enhancing LLM reliability.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the
development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities,
MLLMs often suffer from an over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language
bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal
tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret
the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within our framework,
we devise a causal graph to elucidate the predictions of MLLMs on VQA problems,
and assess the causal effect of biases through an in-depth causal analysis.
Motivated by the causal graph, we introduce a novel MORE dataset, consisting of
12,000 VQA instances. This dataset is designed to challenge MLLMs' abilities,
necessitating multi-hop reasoning and the surmounting of unimodal biases.
Furthermore, we propose two strategies to mitigate unimodal biases and enhance
MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, including a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA)
framework for limited-access MLLMs and the refinement of open-source MLLMs
through fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments offer
valuable insights for future research.

with human values and societal norms to ensure their reliability and safety has
become crucial. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and
Constitutional AI (CAI) have been proposed for LLM alignment. However, these
methods require either heavy human annotations or explicitly pre-defined
constitutions, which are labor-intensive and resource-consuming. To overcome
these drawbacks, we study constitution-based LLM alignment and propose a
data-driven constitution discovery and self-alignment framework called
IterAlign. IterAlign leverages red teaming to unveil the weaknesses of an LLM
and automatically discovers new constitutions using a stronger LLM. These
constitutions are then used to guide self-correction of the base LLM. Such a
constitution discovery pipeline can be run iteratively and automatically to
discover new constitutions that specifically target the alignment gaps in the
current LLM. Empirical results on several safety benchmark datasets and
multiple base LLMs show that IterAlign successfully improves truthfulness,
helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty, improving the LLM alignment by up to
$13.5\%$ in harmlessness.

are then converted to formal syntax by a domain-expert leading to increased
design costs. This paper assesses the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in converting between natural language descriptions and formal
specifications. Existing work has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs in
generating formal syntax such as source code but such experiments are typically
hand-crafted and use problems that are likely to be in the training set of
LLMs, and often require human-annotated datasets. We propose an approach that
can use two copies of an LLM in conjunction with an off-the-shelf verifier to
automatically evaluate its translation abilities without any additional human
input. Our approach generates formal syntax using language grammars to
automatically generate a dataset. We conduct an empirical evaluation to measure
the accuracy of this translation task and show that SOTA LLMs cannot adequately
solve this task, limiting their current utility in the design of complex
systems.

user-generated content on social media platforms, the pervasiveness of
offensive language, such as hate speech or cyberbullying, in the digital space
remains a significant challenge. Given the importance of maintaining a
civilized and respectful online environment, there is an urgent and growing
need for automatic systems capable of detecting offensive speech in real time.
However, developing effective systems for processing languages such as Chinese
presents a significant challenge, owing to the language's complex and nuanced
nature, which makes it difficult to process automatically. This paper provides
a comprehensive overview of offensive language detection in Chinese, examining
current benchmarks and approaches and highlighting specific models and tools
for addressing the unique challenges of detecting offensive language in this
complex language. The primary objective of this survey is to explore the
existing techniques and identify potential avenues for further research that
can address the cultural and linguistic complexities of Chinese.

language models (LLMs) utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data for mathematical
reasoning tasks. Despite the fine-tuned LLMs, challenges persist, such as
incorrect, missing, and redundant steps in CoT generation leading to
inaccuracies in answer predictions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
dual instruction tuning strategy to meticulously model mathematical reasoning
from both forward and reverse directions. This involves introducing the
Intermediate Reasoning State Prediction task (forward reasoning) and the
Instruction Reconstruction task (reverse reasoning) to enhance the LLMs'
understanding and execution of instructions. Training instances for these tasks
are constructed based on existing mathematical instruction tuning datasets.
Subsequently, LLMs undergo multi-task fine-tuning using both existing
mathematical instructions and the newly created data. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and domain generalization of the dual instruction
tuning strategy across various mathematical reasoning tasks.

                                        <span>  Recent work has uncovered promising ways to extract well-calibrated
confidence estimates from language models (LMs), where the model's confidence
score reflects how likely it is to be correct. However, while LMs may appear
well-calibrated over broad distributions, this often hides significant
miscalibration within narrower slices (e.g., systemic over-confidence in math
can balance out systemic under-confidence in history, yielding perfect
calibration in aggregate). To attain well-calibrated confidence estimates for
any slice of a distribution, we propose a new framework for few-shot
slice-specific recalibration. Specifically, we train a recalibration model that
takes in a few unlabeled examples from any given slice and predicts a curve
that remaps confidence scores to be more accurate for that slice. Our trained
model can recalibrate for arbitrary new slices, without using any labeled data
from that slice. This enables us to identify domain-specific confidence
thresholds above which the LM's predictions can be trusted, and below which it
should abstain. Experiments show that our few-shot recalibrator consistently
outperforms existing calibration methods, for instance improving calibration
error for PaLM2-Large on MMLU by 16%, as compared to temperature scaling.

                                        <span>  Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are commonly designed with the
presumption that each utterance represents a single intent. However, this
assumption may not accurately reflect real-world situations, where users
frequently express multiple intents within a single utterance. While there is
an emerging interest in multi-intent detection (MID), existing in-domain
datasets such as MixATIS and MixSNIPS have limitations in their formulation. To
address these issues, we present BlendX, a suite of refined datasets featuring
more diverse patterns than their predecessors, elevating both its complexity
and diversity. For dataset construction, we utilize both rule-based heuristics
as well as a generative tool -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- which is augmented with a
similarity-driven strategy for utterance selection. To ensure the quality of
the proposed datasets, we also introduce three novel metrics that assess the
statistical properties of an utterance related to word count, conjunction use,
and pronoun usage. Extensive experiments on BlendX reveal that state-of-the-art
MID models struggle with the challenges posed by the new datasets, highlighting
the need to reexamine the current state of the MID field. The dataset is

                                        <span>  Transformer structure has achieved great success in multiple applied machine
learning communities, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer
vision (CV) and information retrieval (IR). Transformer architecture's core
mechanism -- attention requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity in training and $O(n)$
time complexity in inference. Many works have been proposed to improve the
attention mechanism's scalability, such as Flash Attention and Multi-query
Attention. A different line of work aims to design new mechanisms to replace
attention. Recently, a notable model structure -- Mamba, which is based on
state space models, has achieved transformer-equivalent performance in multiple
sequence modeling tasks.
  In this work, we examine \mamba's efficacy through the lens of a classical IR
task -- document ranking. A reranker model takes a query and a document as
input, and predicts a scalar relevance score. This task demands the language
model's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the
interaction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models
achieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the
same training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in
comparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention. We
hope this study can serve as a starting point to explore Mamba models in other
classical IR tasks. Our code implementation and trained checkpoints are made
public to facilitate
reproducibility.\footnote{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/RankMamba}.

limitation in their regional understanding ability. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{RegionVLM}, equipped with explicit regional modeling capabilities,

understanding.

                                        <span>  Metaphors are ubiquitous in daily life, yet detecting them poses a
significant challenge. Previous approaches often struggled with improper
application of language rules and overlooked the issue of data sparsity. To
address these challenges, we introduce knowledge distillation and prompt
learning into metaphor detection. Specifically, we devise a prompt learning
template tailored for the metaphor detection task. By masking target words and
providing relevant prompt information, we guide the model to accurately infer
the contextual meaning of these words. This approach not only mitigates the
interference from the literal meaning of target words but also ensures the
proper utilization of MIP language rules for metaphor detection. Moreover, we
employ a teacher model equipped with prior knowledge to generate meaningful
soft labels, guiding the optimization process of the student model. The
inclusion of soft labels, akin to label smoothing, helps alleviate the model's
tendency towards over-confidence and effectively addresses the challenge of
data sparsity. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

                                        <span>  Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision,
evolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning
image-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as
CLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for
real-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel
visual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text
descriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and
multiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and
knowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual
table generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual
representations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone
visual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs
that are built on CLIP visual embeddings. Our code is available at

research involving scientific document representation. In this position piece,
we quantitatively show that the literature is largely multilingual and argue
that current models and benchmarks should reflect this linguistic diversity. We
provide evidence that text-based models fail to create meaningful

impacts of using English-only models non-discriminately across a multilingual
domain. We end with suggestions for the NLP community on how to improve
performance on non-English documents.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the creation
of fake news, particularly in complex fields like healthcare. Studies highlight
the gap in the deceptive power of LLM-generated fake news with and without
human assistance, yet the potential of prompting techniques has not been fully
explored. Thus, this work aims to determine whether prompting strategies can
effectively narrow this gap. Current LLM-based fake news attacks require human
intervention for information gathering and often miss details and fail to
maintain context consistency. Therefore, to better understand threat tactics,
we propose a strong fake news attack method called conditional
Variational-autoencoder-Like Prompt (VLPrompt). Unlike current methods,
VLPrompt eliminates the need for additional data collection while maintaining
contextual coherence and preserving the intricacies of the original text. To
propel future research on detecting VLPrompt attacks, we created a new dataset
named VLPrompt fake news (VLPFN) containing real and fake texts. Our
experiments, including various detection methods and novel human study metrics,
were conducted to assess their performance on our dataset, yielding numerous
findings.

different topics and are divided into phases with different language setups.
The corpus presents a challenging set for automatic speech recognition (ASR),

variants (Modern Standard Arabic, Gulf Arabic, and Egyptian Arabic) and English
used with various accents. Adding to the complexity of the corpus, there is
also code-switching between these languages and dialects. As part of our work,

and (2) automatic morphological annotations, including tokenization,
lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.

hallucinations that misalign with world knowledge. Despite extensive efforts to
detect and mitigate hallucinations, understanding their internal mechanisms
remains elusive. Our study investigates the mechanistic causes of
hallucination, specifically non-factual ones where the LM incorrectly predicts
object attributes in response to subject-relation queries. With causal
mediation analysis and embedding space projection, we identify two general
mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs of various scales and
designs: 1) insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and
2) failing to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention
heads and MLPs. These two mechanisms exhibit varying degrees of subject-object
association, predictive uncertainty and perturbation robustness. Additionally,
we scrutinize LM pre-training checkpoints, revealing distinct learning dynamics
for the two mechanistic causes of hallucinations. We also highlight how
attribution features from our causal analysis can effectively construct
hallucination detectors. Our work proposes a mechanistic understanding of LM
factual errors.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse
tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers
with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning
and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually
crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently
incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive
games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with
Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise
from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy.
Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process
for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro
iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, fine-tuning its
irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is
employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy
payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em,
outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro
can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits
numerous LLM-based applications.

                                        <span>  The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive
attention. A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflexion and self-refine,
refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback. However,
recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection
is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality
of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or
high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback,
which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It
adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request,
contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist
which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method
endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover,
their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that
LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and
stable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and
translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and
generality of our strategy.

significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and
prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,
content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant
challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into
individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them
individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with
novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot
way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector
quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content,
prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion
model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding
prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and
efficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a
divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the
state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and
intelligibility, and achieves on-par quality with human recordings.
Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K
hours of training data.

also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in accordance with the SPADE

utilize tools, especially through API calls, has advanced notably. This
progress has necessitated more accurate evaluation methods. Many existing
studies adopt static evaluation, where they assess AI assistants' API call
based on pre-defined dialogue histories. However, such evaluation method can be
misleading, as an AI assistant might fail in generating API calls from
preceding human interaction in real cases. Instead of the resource-intensive
method of direct human-machine interactions, we propose Automated Dynamic
Evaluation (AutoDE) to assess an assistant's API call capability without human
involvement. In our framework, we endeavor to closely mirror genuine human
conversation patterns in human-machine interactions, using a LLM-based user
agent, equipped with a user script to ensure human alignment. Experimental
results highlight that AutoDE uncovers errors overlooked by static evaluations,
aligning more closely with human assessment. Testing four AI assistants using
our crafted benchmark, our method further mirrored human evaluation compared to
conventional static evaluations.

biographical information in the context of digital humanities and related
subjects. There is a growing interest in the community to build datasets
capable of training machine learning models to extract relationships. However,
annotating such datasets can be expensive and time-consuming, in addition to
being limited to English. This paper applies guided distant supervision to
create a large biographical relationship extraction dataset for German. Our
dataset, composed of more than 80,000 instances for nine relationship types, is
the largest biographical German relationship extraction dataset. We also create
a manually annotated dataset with 2000 instances to evaluate the models and
release it together with the dataset compiled using guided distant supervision.
We train several state-of-the-art machine learning models on the automatically
created dataset and release them as well. Furthermore, we experiment with
multilingual and cross-lingual experiments that could benefit many low-resource
languages.

system identification. GlotScript-R is a resource that provides the attested
writing systems for more than 7,000 languages. It is compiled by aggregating
information from existing writing system resources. GlotScript-T is a writing
system identification tool that covers all 161 Unicode 15.0 scripts. For an
input text, it returns its script distribution where scripts are identified by
ISO 15924 codes. We also present two use cases for GlotScript. First, we
demonstrate that GlotScript can help cleaning multilingual corpora such as mC4
and OSCAR. Second, we analyze the tokenization of a number of language models
such as GPT-4 using GlotScript and provide insights on the coverage of low
resource scripts and languages by each language model. We hope that GlotScript
will become a useful resource for work on low resource languages in the NLP
community. GlotScript-R and GlotScript-T are available at

                                        <span>  With the advancements of transformer-based architectures, we observe the rise
of natural language preprocessing (NLPre) tools capable of solving preliminary
NLP tasks (e.g. tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, or
morphological analysis) without any external linguistic guidance. It is arduous
to compare novel solutions to well-entrenched preprocessing toolkits, relying
on rule-based morphological analysers or dictionaries. Aware of the
shortcomings of existing NLPre evaluation approaches, we investigate a novel
method of reliable and fair evaluation and performance reporting. Inspired by
the GLUE benchmark, the proposed language-centric benchmarking system enables
comprehensive ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools, while credibly
tracking their performance. The prototype application is configured for Polish
and integrated with the thoroughly assembled NLPre-PL benchmark. Based on this
benchmark, we conduct an extensive evaluation of a variety of Polish NLPre
systems. To facilitate the construction of benchmarking environments for other
languages, e.g. NLPre-GA for Irish or NLPre-ZH for Chinese, we ensure full
customization of the publicly released source code of the benchmarking system.

                                        <span>  Generating accurate Structured Querying Language (SQL) is a long-standing
problem, especially in matching users' semantic queries with structured
databases and then generating structured SQL. Existing models typically input
queries and database schemas into the LLM and rely on the LLM to perform
semantic-structure matching and generate structured SQL. However, such
solutions overlook the structural information within user queries and
databases, which can be utilized to enhance the generation of structured SQL.
This oversight can lead to inaccurate or unexecutable SQL generation. To fully
exploit the structure, we propose a structure-to-SQL framework, which leverages
the inherent structure information to improve the SQL generation of LLMs.
Specifically, we introduce our Structure Guided SQL~(SGU-SQL) generation model.
SGU-SQL first links user queries and databases in a structure-enhanced manner.
It then decomposes complicated linked structures with grammar trees to guide
the LLM to generate the SQL step by step. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets illustrate that SGU-SQL can outperform sixteen SQL
generation baselines.

extraction, consisting of two subtasks: named entity recognition and relation
extraction. However, most existing joint extraction methods suffer from issues
of feature confusion or inadequate interaction between the two subtasks.
Addressing these challenges, in this work, we propose a Co-Attention network
for joint entity and Relation Extraction (CARE). Our approach includes adopting
a parallel encoding strategy to learn separate representations for each
subtask, aiming to avoid feature overlap or confusion. At the core of our
approach is the co-attention module that captures two-way interaction between
the two subtasks, allowing the model to leverage entity information for
relation prediction and vice versa, thus promoting mutual enhancement. Through
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for joint entity and relation
extraction (NYT, WebNLG, and SciERC), we demonstrate that our proposed model
outperforms existing baseline models. Our code will be available at

                                        <span>  The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human
writing poses a significant risk of abuse. However, such abuse may be
counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by
a language model rather than a human author. Some previous approaches to this
problem have relied on supervised methods by training on corpora of confirmed
human- and machine- written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification
poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them
brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of newer language
models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the
detectors. Other approaches require access to the models that may have
generated a document in question, which is often impractical. In light of these
challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples
from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to
leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text.
Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors
are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including
state-of-the-art large language models like Llama-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.
Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific
language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which
model generated a given document. The code and data to reproduce our
experiments are available at

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to
provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as
'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially
harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the
weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing
jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require
optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization
or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two
aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we
propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to
generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing
the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the
inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze
the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority,
and propose corresponding defense strategies. We hope that our research can
catalyze both the academic community and LLMs developers towards the provision
of safer and more regulated LLMs. The code is available at

visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain
abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,
locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided
generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the
model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to
generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the
limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme,
facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can
function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document
images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU
tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance
over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information
extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

                                        <span>  Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts
the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes
the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some
research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via
optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs
also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model,
raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent
studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated
to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of
corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based
learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable
tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with
adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and
develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs
by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the
target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger
tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of
$\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by
$\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and
API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

                                        <span>  Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate
text with supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the
answer and makes the LLM's output more reliable. Retrieval plays a crucial role
in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only
supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve
as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the
widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit
the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since
they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have
not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does
not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the
correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose \LLatrieval (Large Language
Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it
verifies that the retrieved documents can sufficiently support answering the
question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and
facilitate the retrieval result to fully support verifiable generation.
Experiments show that LLatrieval significantly outperforms extensive baselines
and achieves state-of-the-art results.

analysis by revealing aligned latent topics. However, most existing methods
suffer from producing repetitive topics that hinder further analysis and
performance decline caused by low-coverage dictionaries. In this paper, we
propose the Cross-lingual Topic Modeling with Mutual Information (InfoCTM).
Instead of the direct alignment in previous work, we propose a topic alignment
with mutual information method. This works as a regularization to properly
align topics and prevent degenerate topic representations of words, which
mitigates the repetitive topic issue. To address the low-coverage dictionary
issue, we further propose a cross-lingual vocabulary linking method that finds
more linked cross-lingual words for topic alignment beyond the translations of
a given dictionary. Extensive experiments on English, Chinese, and Japanese
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
producing more coherent, diverse, and well-aligned topics and showing better
transferability for cross-lingual classification tasks.

ability to generate human-like text, has raised concerns about misinformation
and ethical implications. Addressing these concerns necessitates the
development of robust methods to detect and attribute text generated by LLMs.
This paper investigates "Cross-Model Detection," by evaluating whether a
classifier trained to distinguish between source LLM-generated and
human-written text can also detect text from a target LLM without further
training. The study comprehensively explores various LLM sizes and families,
and assesses the impact of conversational fine-tuning techniques, quantization,
and watermarking on classifier generalization. The research also explores Model
Attribution, encompassing source model identification, model family, and model
size classification, in addition to quantization and watermarking detection.
Our results reveal several key findings: a clear inverse relationship between
classifier effectiveness and model size, with larger LLMs being more
challenging to detect, especially when the classifier is trained on data from
smaller models. Training on data from similarly sized LLMs can improve
detection performance from larger models but may lead to decreased performance
when dealing with smaller models. Additionally, model attribution experiments
show promising results in identifying source models and model families,
highlighting detectable signatures in LLM-generated text, with particularly

                                        <span>  To help the open-source community have a better understanding of
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and
release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only
MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T
tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more
favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the
potential effectiveness for future LLM development.
  One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the
routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant
findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and
Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are
predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The
token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and
remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance
degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations,
where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped.
Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and
analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential
strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving
off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.

                                        <span>  The large success of deep learning based methods in Visual Question Answering
(VQA) has concurrently increased the demand for explainable methods. Most
methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on generating
post-hoc explanations rather than taking an intrinsic approach, the latter
characterizing an interpretable model. In this work, we introduce an
interpretable approach for graph-based VQA and demonstrate competitive
performance on the GQA dataset. This approach bridges the gap between
interpretability and performance. Our model is designed to intrinsically
produce a subgraph during the question-answering process as its explanation,
providing insight into the decision making. To evaluate the quality of these
generated subgraphs, we compare them against established post-hoc
explainability methods for graph neural networks, and perform a human
evaluation. Moreover, we present quantitative metrics that correlate with the
evaluations of human assessors, acting as automatic metrics for the generated
explanatory subgraphs. Our implementation is available at

challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent,
untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external
databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation,
particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge
updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically
merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of
external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed
examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG,
the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the
tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the
generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the
state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components,
providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems.
Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and
benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced
and points out prospective avenues for research and development.

straightforward, and effective technique for masking image patches during
pre-training of a vision-language model. GLIP builds on Fast Language-Image
Pre-Training (FLIP), which randomly masks image patches while training a CLIP
model. GLIP replaces random masking with centered masking, that uses a Gaussian
distribution and is inspired by the importance of image patches at the center
of the image. GLIP retains the same computational savings as FLIP, while
improving performance across a range of downstream datasets and tasks, as
demonstrated by our experimental results. We show the benefits of GLIP to be
easy to obtain, requiring no delicate tuning of the Gaussian, and also
applicable to data sets containing images without an obvious center focus.

                                        <span>  The impressive development of large language models (LLMs) is expanding into
the realm of large multimodal models (LMMs), which incorporate multiple types
of data beyond text. However, the nature of multimodal models leads to
significant expenses in the creation of training data. Furthermore,
constructing multilingual data for LMMs presents its own set of challenges due
to language diversity and complexity. Therefore, in this study, we propose two
cost-effective methods to solve this problem: (1) vocabulary expansion and
pretraining of multilingual LLM for specific languages, and (2) automatic and
elaborate construction of multimodal datasets using GPT4-V. Based on015 these
methods, we constructed a 91K English-Korean-Chinese multilingual, multimodal
training dataset. Additionally, we developed a bilingual multimodal model that
exhibits excellent performance in both Korean and English, surpassing existing
approaches.

                                        <span>  Pretrained language models (PLMs) have made remarkable progress in
table-to-text generation tasks. However, the lack of domain-specific knowledge
makes it challenging to bridge the topological gap between tabular data and
text, especially in real-world applications with limited resources. To mitigate
the limitation of insufficient labeled data, we propose a novel framework:
Adapt-Knowledge-to-Generate (AKG). The core insight of AKG is to adapt
unlabeled domain-specific knowledge into the model, which brings at least three
benefits: (1) it injects representation of normal table-related descriptions to
bridge the topological gap between tabular data and texts; (2) it enables us to
use large amounts of unlabeled domain-specific knowledge fully, which can
alleviate the PLMs' inherent shortcomings of lacking domain knowledge; (3) it
allows us to design various tasks to employ the domain-specific knowledge.
Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted on three open-domain, few-shot
natural language generation (NLG) data sets: Humans, Songs, and Books. Compared
to previous state-of-the-art approaches, our model achieves superior
performance in terms of both fluency and accuracy as judged by human and
automatic evaluations.

                                        <span>  To address intricate real-world tasks, there has been a rising interest in
tool utilization in applications of large language models (LLMs). To develop
LLM-based agents, it usually requires LLMs to understand many tool functions
from different tool documentation. But these documentations could be diverse,
redundant or incomplete, which immensely affects the capability of LLMs in
using tools. To solve this, we introduce EASYTOOL, a framework transforming
diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool
instruction for easier tool usage. EasyTool purifies essential information from
extensive tool documentation of different sources, and elaborates a unified
interface (i.e., tool instruction) to offer standardized tool descriptions and
functionalities for LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments on multiple
different tasks demonstrate that EasyTool can significantly reduce token
consumption and improve the performance of tool utilization in real-world
scenarios. Our code will be available at

diverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context
information, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between
high-resource and low-resource languages. Nonetheless, there is only a handful
of works explored ICL for low-resource languages with most of them focusing on
relatively high-resource languages, such as French and Spanish. In this work,
we extensively study ICL and its cross-lingual variation (X-ICL) on 25
low-resource and 7 relatively higher-resource languages. Our study not only
assesses the effectiveness of ICL with LLMs in low-resource languages but also
identifies the shortcomings of in-context label alignment, and introduces a
more effective alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we provide valuable
insights into various facets of ICL for low-resource languages. Our study
concludes the significance of few-shot in-context information on enhancing the
low-resource understanding quality of LLMs through semantically relevant
information by closing the language gap in the target language and aligning the
semantics between the targeted low-resource and the high-resource language that
the model is proficient in. Our work highlights the importance of advancing ICL
research, particularly for low-resource languages.

directions. For a speaker, responding passively or leading proactively would
result in rather different responses. However, most dialogue systems focus on
training a holistic response generation model without any distinction among
different initiatives. It leads to the cross-contamination problem, where the
model confuses different initiatives and generates inappropriate responses.
Moreover, obtaining plenty of human annotations for initiative labels can be
expensive. To address this issue, we propose a general mix-Initiative Dynamic
Prefix Tuning framework (IDPT) to decouple different initiatives from the
generation model, which learns initiative-aware prefixes in both supervised and
unsupervised settings. Specifically, IDPT decouples initiative factors into
different prefix parameters and uses the attention mechanism to adjust the
selection of initiatives in guiding generation dynamically. The prefix
parameters can be tuned towards accurate initiative prediction as well as
mix-initiative response generation. Extensive experiments on two public
dialogue datasets show that the proposed IDPT outperforms previous baselines on
both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It also manages to generate
appropriate responses with manipulated initiatives.

downstream NLP tasks. However, pre-training large language models demands
substantial memory and training compute. Furthermore, due to the substantial
resources required, many PLM weights are confidential. Consequently, users are
compelled to share their data with model owners for fine-tuning specific tasks.
To overcome the limitations, we introduce Plug-in External Memory Adaptation
(PEMA), a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, enabling PLM
fine-tuning without requiring access to all the weights. PEMA integrates with
context representations from test data during inference to perform downstream
tasks. It uses external memory to store PLM-generated context representations
mapped with target tokens. Our method utilizes weight matrices of LoRA-like
bottlenecked adapter in the PLM's final layer to enhance efficiency. Our
approach also includes Gradual Unrolling, a novel interpolation strategy to
improve generation quality. We validate PEMA's effectiveness through
experiments on syntactic and real datasets for machine translation and style
transfer. Our findings show that PEMA outperforms other PEFT approaches in
memory and latency efficiency for training, and also excels in maintaining
sentence meaning and generating appropriate language and styles.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in various linguistic
applications, including text summarization and controlled text generation.
However, studies into their capacity of switching between styles via
fine-tuning remain underexplored. This study concentrates on textual
professionalism and introduces a novel methodology, named ProSwitch, which
equips a language model with the ability to produce both professional and
non-professional responses through knowledge-guided instruction tuning.
ProSwitch unfolds across three phases: data preparation for gathering domain
knowledge and training corpus; instruction tuning for optimizing language
models with multiple levels of instruction formats; and comprehensive
evaluation for assessing the professionalism discrimination and reference-based
quality of generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against both
general and specialized language models reveals that our approach outperforms
baselines in switching between professional and non-professional text
generation.

                                        <span>  Post-training quantization (PTQ) has played a key role in compressing large
language models (LLMs) with ultra-low costs. However, existing PTQ methods only
focus on handling the outliers within one layer or one block, which ignores the
dependency of blocks and leads to severe performance degradation in low-bit
settings. In this paper, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ
method for LLMs. CBQ employs a cross-block dependency using a homologous
reconstruction scheme, establishing long-range dependencies across multiple
blocks to minimize error accumulation. Furthermore, CBQ incorporates a
coarse-to-fine preprocessing (CFP) strategy for suppressing weight and
activation outliers, coupled with an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique for
precise weight quantization. These innovations enable CBQ to not only handle
extreme outliers effectively but also improve overall quantization accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization
(W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across
various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ quantizes the 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model
within only 4.3 hours on a single GPU, achieving a commendable tradeoff between
performance and quantization efficiency.

that non-expert users can jailbreak LLMs by simply manipulating their prompts;
resulting in degenerate output behavior, privacy and security breaches,

studies have been conducted to formalize and analyze these attacks and their
mitigations. We bridge this gap by proposing a formalism and a taxonomy of

OPT, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5-XXL). We further discuss the challenges of jailbreak

                                        <span>  Vision-Language (VL) models with the Two-Tower architecture have dominated
visual-language representation learning in recent years. Current VL models
either use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse
both modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the
last-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal
encoders into the top cross-modal encoder. Both approaches potentially restrict
vision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this
paper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that
build a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer
of the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal
alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different
semantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.
Pre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the
VQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming
the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training
data and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.
Notably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of
81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger
datasets. Code and checkpoints are available at

several candidates based on a given user and system utterance history. Most
existing works primarily focus on post-training and fine-tuning tailored for
cross-encoders. However, there are no post-training methods tailored for dense
encoders in dialogue response selection. We argue that when the current
language model, based on dense dialogue systems (such as BERT), is employed as
a dense encoder, it separately encodes dialogue context and response, leading
to a struggle to achieve the alignment of both representations. Thus, we
propose Dial-MAE (Dialogue Contextual Masking Auto-Encoder), a straightforward
yet effective post-training technique tailored for dense encoders in dialogue
response selection. Dial-MAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to
compress the dialogue semantics into dense vectors, which achieves better
alignment between the features of the dialogue context and response. Our
experiments have demonstrated that Dial-MAE is highly effective, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on two commonly evaluated benchmarks.

foundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured
nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization.
We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data,
according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate
data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical
impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a
state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training
is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical
tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and
then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we
address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long
context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms
other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a
mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards
healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release
SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as
datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a
significant contribution to the healthcare industry.

accelerated the development of applications in understanding integrated texts
and images. Recent works leverage image-caption datasets to train MLLMs,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks. However, there
are few studies exploring which layers of MLLMs make the most effort to the
global image information, which plays vital roles in multimodal comprehension

can encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors
perform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost

through object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may
excessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to
encode global information. Our code and data are released via

language models (LLMs) as part of encoders for biomedical imaging tasks, a
domain traditionally devoid of language or textual data. The approach diverges
from established methodologies by utilizing a frozen transformer block,
extracted from pre-trained LLMs, as an innovative encoder layer for the direct
processing of visual tokens. This strategy represents a significant departure
from the standard multi-modal vision-language frameworks, which typically hinge
on language-driven prompts and inputs. We found that these LLMs could boost
performance across a spectrum of biomedical imaging applications, including
both 2D and 3D visual classification tasks, serving as plug-and-play boosters.
More interestingly, as a byproduct, we found that the proposed framework
achieved superior performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on
extensive, standardized datasets in MedMNIST-2D and 3D. Through this work, we
aim to open new avenues for employing LLMs in biomedical imaging and enriching
the understanding of their potential in this specialized domain.

models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and
query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning.
This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that
bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and
query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of
fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose
Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the
appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the
proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc
document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction
task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation
and query-document relations.

mathematical reasoning. Despite significant efforts invested in improving
prefix prompts or reasoning process, the crucial role of problem context might
have been neglected. Accurate recognition of inputs is fundamental for solving
mathematical tasks, as ill-formed problems could potentially mislead LLM's
reasoning. In this study, we propose a new approach named Problem Elaboration
Prompting (PEP) to enhance the mathematical capacities of LLMs. Specifically,
PEP decomposes and elucidates the problem context before reasoning, therefore
enhancing the context modeling and parsing efficiency. Experiments across
datasets and models demonstrate promising performances: (1) PEP demonstrates an
overall enhancement in various mathematical tasks. For instance, with the
GPT-3.5 model, PEP exhibits improvements of 9.93% and 8.80% on GSM8k through
greedy decoding and self-consistency, respectively. (2) PEP can be easily
implemented and integrated with other prompting methods. (3) PEP shows
particular strength in handling distraction problems.

following the invasion of Ukraine, Russian media outlets such as Russia Today
and Sputnik News were banned throughout Europe. To maintain viewership, many of
these Russian outlets began to heavily promote their content on messaging
services like Telegram. In this work, we study how 16 Russian media outlets
interacted with and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. Leveraging
the foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes processes, we
trace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show
that news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram but
that they source material from the messaging platform. For example, across the
websites in our study, between 2.3% (ura.news) and 26.7% (ukraina.ru) of
articles discussed content that originated/resulted from activity on Telegram.
Finally, tracking the spread of individual topics, we measure the rate at which
news outlets and Telegram channels disseminate content within the Russian media
ecosystem, finding that websites like ura.news and Telegram channels such as
@genshab are the most effective at disseminating their content.

the first appearance of large language models (LLMs), yet their huge memory
consumption has become a major roadblock to large-scale training. Parameter
Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been
proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match
full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to
complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on
fine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across
different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple
training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter
training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name
it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA,
which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and
randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results
show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or
even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA
consistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\%$-$37\%$ in terms of MT-Bench
scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or
better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating
its effectiveness across different domains.

                                        <span>  We empirically study a simple layer-pruning strategy for popular families of
open-weight pretrained LLMs, finding minimal degradation of performance on
different question-answering benchmarks until after a large fraction (up to
half) of the layers are removed. To prune these models, we identify the optimal
block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to
"heal" the damage, we perform a small amount of finetuning. In particular, we
use parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, specifically quantization
and Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA), such that each of our experiments can be
performed on a single A100 GPU. From a practical perspective, these results
suggest that layer pruning methods can complement other PEFT strategies to
further reduce computational resources of finetuning on the one hand, and can
improve the memory and latency of inference on the other hand. From a
scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers
implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the
parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play
a critical role in storing knowledge.

                                        <span>  Natural Language Processing (NLP) models optimized for predictive performance
often make high confidence errors and suffer from vulnerability to adversarial
and out-of-distribution data. Existing work has mainly focused on mitigation of
such errors using either humans or an automated approach. In this study, we
explore the usage of large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation as a
potential solution to the issue of NLP models making wrong predictions with
high confidence during classification tasks. We compare the effectiveness of
synthetic data generated by LLMs with that of human data obtained via the same
procedure. For mitigation, humans or LLMs provide natural language
characterizations of high confidence misclassifications to generate synthetic
data, which are then used to extend the training set. We conduct an extensive
evaluation of our approach on three classification tasks and demonstrate its
effectiveness in reducing the number of high confidence misclassifications
present in the model, all while maintaining the same level of accuracy.
Moreover, we find that the cost gap between humans and LLMs surpasses an order
of magnitude, as LLMs attain human-like performance while being more scalable.

                                        <span>  Question answering (QA) and Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks have
significantly advanced in recent years due to the rapid development of deep
learning techniques and, more recently, large language models. At the same
time, many benchmark datasets have become available for QA and MRC tasks.
However, most existing large-scale benchmark datasets have been created
predominantly using synchronous document collections like Wikipedia or the Web.
Archival document collections, such as historical newspapers, contain valuable
information from the past that is still not widely used to train large language
models. To further contribute to advancing QA and MRC tasks and to overcome the
limitation of previous datasets, we introduce ChroniclingAmericaQA, a
large-scale dataset with 485K question-answer pairs created based on the
historical newspaper collection Chronicling America. Our dataset is constructed
from a subset of the Chronicling America newspaper collection spanning 120
years. One of the significant challenges for utilizing digitized historical
newspaper collections is the low quality of OCR text. Therefore, to enable
realistic testing of QA models, our dataset can be used in three different
ways: answering questions from raw and noisy content, answering questions from
cleaner, corrected version of the content, as well as answering questions from
scanned images of newspaper pages. This and the fact that ChroniclingAmericaQA
spans the longest time period among available QA datasets make it quite a
unique and useful resource.

is a hallmark of English morphology. In conversion, a word with one part of
speech is placed in a non-prototypical context, where it is coerced to behave
as if it had a different part of speech. However, while this process affects a
large part of the English lexicon, little work has been done to establish the
degree to which language models capture this type of generalization. This paper
reports the first study on the behavior of large language models with reference
to conversion. We design a task for testing lexical-syntactic flexibility --
the degree to which models can generalize over words in a construction with a
non-prototypical part of speech. This task is situated within a natural
language inference paradigm. We test the abilities of five language models --
two proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), three open-source models (Mistral
7B, Falcon 40B, and Llama 2 70B). We find that GPT-4 performs best on the task,
followed by GPT-3.5, but that the open source language models are also able to
perform it and that the 7B parameter Mistral displays as little difference
between its baseline performance on the natural language inference task and the
non-prototypical syntactic category task, as the massive GPT-4.

structure (i.e., a set of dialog states and their temporal transitions) of a
given goal-oriented dialog. It is a critical component for modern dialog system
design and discourse analysis. Existing DSI approaches are often purely
data-driven, deploy models that infer latent states without access to domain
knowledge, underperform when the training corpus is limited/noisy, or have
difficulty when test dialogs exhibit distributional shifts from the training
domain. This work explores a neural-symbolic approach as a potential solution
to these problems. We introduce Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic Dialogue
Structure Induction (NEUPSL DSI), a principled approach that injects symbolic
knowledge into the latent space of a generative neural model. We conduct a
thorough empirical investigation on the effect of NEUPSL DSI learning on hidden
representation quality, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization
performance. Over three dialog structure induction datasets and across
unsupervised and semi-supervised settings for standard and cross-domain
generalization, the injection of symbolic knowledge using NEUPSL DSI provides a
consistent boost in performance over the canonical baselines.

                                        <span>  Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features. While these maps allow for the prediction
of point-wise saliency maps when queried for a certain language concept,
large-scale environments and abstract queries beyond the object level still
pose a considerable hurdle, ultimately limiting language-grounded robotic
navigation. In this work, we present HOV-SG, a hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D
scene graph mapping approach for language-grounded robot navigation. Leveraging
open-vocabulary vision foundation models, we first obtain state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary segment-level maps in 3D and subsequently construct a 3D scene
graph hierarchy consisting of floor, room, and object concepts, each enriched
with open-vocabulary features. Our approach is able to represent multi-story
buildings and allows robotic traversal of those using a cross-floor Voronoi
graph. HOV-SG is evaluated on three distinct datasets and surpasses previous
baselines in open-vocabulary semantic accuracy on the object, room, and floor
level while producing a 75% reduction in representation size compared to dense
open-vocabulary maps. In order to prove the efficacy and generalization
capabilities of HOV-SG, we showcase successful long-horizon
language-conditioned robot navigation within real-world multi-storage
environments. We provide code and trial video data at http://hovsg.github.io/.

                                        <span>  This scientific report presents a novel methodology for the early prediction
of important political events using News datasets. The methodology leverages
natural language processing, graph theory, clique analysis, and semantic
relationships to uncover hidden predictive signals within the data. Initially,
we designed a preliminary version of the method and tested it on a few events.
This analysis revealed limitations in the initial research phase. We then
enhanced the model in two key ways: first, we added a filtration step to only
consider politically relevant news before further processing; second, we
adjusted the input features to make the alert system more sensitive to
significant spikes in the data. After finalizing the improved methodology, we
tested it on eleven events including US protests, the Ukraine war, and French
protests. Results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to
baseline methods. Through targeted refinements, our model can now provide
earlier and more accurate predictions of major political events based on subtle
patterns in news data.

increasingly used to create smaller scalable models. However, little is known
about their robustness to minority subgroups defined by the labels and
attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we investigate the effects of 18
different compression methods and settings on the subgroup robustness of BERT
language models. We show that worst-group performance does not depend on model
size alone, but also on the compression method used. Additionally, we find that
model compression does not always worsen the performance on minority subgroups.
Altogether, our analysis serves to further research into the subgroup
robustness of model compression.

                                        <span>  Many recent language model (LM) interpretability studies have adopted the
circuits framework, which aims to find the minimal computational subgraph, or
circuit, that explains LM behavior on a given task. Most studies determine
which edges belong in a LM's circuit by performing causal interventions on each
edge independently, but this scales poorly with model size. Edge attribution
patching (EAP), gradient-based approximation to interventions, has emerged as a
scalable but imperfect solution to this problem. In this paper, we introduce a
new method - EAP with integrated gradients (EAP-IG) - that aims to better
maintain a core property of circuits: faithfulness. A circuit is faithful if
all model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's
performance on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits,
rather than the full model. Our experiments demonstrate that circuits found
using EAP are less faithful than those found using EAP-IG, even though both
have high node overlap with circuits found previously using causal
interventions. We conclude more generally that when using circuits to compare
the mechanisms models use to solve tasks, faithfulness, not overlap, is what
should be measured.

                                        <span>  Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a
plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically
appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still
struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt,
oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes
properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from
the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2)
they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by
unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and
prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and
introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a
large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models.
Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised
prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive
validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost
the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while
preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data.
Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by
harnessing the power of LLMs.

perspectives: from an NLP perspective, we introduce a small challenge dataset
for NLI with large lexical overlap, which minimises the possibility of models
discerning entailment solely based on token distinctions, and show that GPT-4
and Llama 2 fail it with strong bias. We then create further challenging
sub-tasks in an effort to explain this failure. From a Computational
Linguistics perspective, we identify a group of constructions with three
classes of adjectives which cannot be distinguished by surface features. This
enables us to probe for LLM's understanding of these constructions in various
ways, and we find that they fail in a variety of ways to distinguish between
them, suggesting that they don't adequately represent their meaning or capture

                                        <span>  Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, there
are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities,
particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG)
answers are required. The misalignment between the task and the evaluation
method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in
this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in
two languages: Chinese and English. We identify a significant issue: LLMs
exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at
specific positions, i.e., the first position. We further quantify the gap
between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their
direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings. Our results reveal a relatively
low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions.
Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence
of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks.
Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the
greater the accuracy. We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms
of expected calibration error. Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs
is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding
space. Our code and models can be accessed at

of treebanks with contributions in over 140 languages. However, the UD
annotations do not tell the full story. Grammatical constructions that convey
meaning through a particular combination of several morphosyntactic elements --
for example, interrogative sentences with special markers and/or word orders --
are not labeled holistically. We argue for (i) augmenting UD annotations with a
'UCxn' annotation layer for such meaning-bearing grammatical constructions, and
(ii) approaching this in a typologically informed way so that morphosyntactic
strategies can be compared across languages. As a case study, we consider five
construction families in ten languages, identifying instances of each
construction in UD treebanks through the use of morphosyntactic patterns. In
addition to findings regarding these particular constructions, our study yields
important insights on methodology for describing and identifying constructions
in language-general and language-particular ways, and lays the foundation for
future constructional enrichment of UD treebanks.

training, which is often impractical to obtain in real-world applications. In
this paper, we introduce continual few-shot event detection (CFED), a more
commonly encountered scenario when a substantial number of labeled samples are
not accessible. The CFED task is challenging as it involves memorizing previous
event types and learning new event types with few-shot samples. To mitigate
these challenges, we propose a memory-based framework: Hierarchical
Augmentation Networks (HANet). To memorize previous event types with limited
memory, we incorporate prototypical augmentation into the memory set. For the
issue of learning new event types in few-shot scenarios, we propose a
contrastive augmentation module for token representations. Despite comparing
with previous state-of-the-art methods, we also conduct comparisons with
ChatGPT. Experiment results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms all of these methods in multiple continual few-shot event detection
tasks.

limited time and interest in various topics to improve their learning
efficiency. To this end, video summarization has been actively researched to
enable users to view only important scenes from a video. However, these studies
focus on either the visual or audio information of a video and extract
important segments in the video. Therefore, there is a risk of missing
important information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on
the blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle
this issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that
considers both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos.
FastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with
on-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial
information for learners. Further, it provides a feature that allows learners
to switch between the summary and original videos for each chapter of the
video, enabling them to adjust the pace of learning based on their interests
and level of understanding. We conducted an evaluation with 40 participants to
assess the effectiveness of our method and confirmed that it reduced viewing
time by 53\% at the same level of comprehension as that when using traditional
video playback methods.

Traditional topic models, however, often fall short in accurately representing
the semantic intricacies of short texts due to their brevity and lack of
contextual data. In our study, we harness the advanced capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to introduce a novel approach termed "Topic Refinement".
This approach does not directly involve itself in the initial modeling of
topics but focuses on improving topics after they have been mined. By employing
prompt engineering, we direct LLMs to eliminate off-topic words within a given
topic, ensuring that only contextually relevant words are preserved or
substituted with ones that fit better semantically. This method emulates
human-like scrutiny and improvement of topics, thereby elevating the semantic
quality of the topics generated by various models. Our comprehensive evaluation
across three unique datasets has shown that our topic refinement approach
significantly enhances the semantic coherence of topics.

GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GPT, and Stable Diffusion, has revolutionized content
creation, enabling non-professionals to produce high-quality content across
various domains. This transformative technology has led to a surge of synthetic
content and sparked legal disputes over copyright infringement. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the
learning capacity of GenAI models for copyright legal analysis, demonstrated
with GPT2 and Stable Diffusion models. Copyright law distinguishes between
original expressions and generic ones (Sc\`enes \`a faire), protecting the
former and permitting reproduction of the latter. However, this distinction has
historically been challenging to make consistently, leading to over-protection
of copyrighted works. GenAI offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance this
legal analysis by revealing shared patterns in preexisting works. We propose a
data-driven approach to identify the genericity of works created by GenAI,
employing "data-driven bias" to assess the genericity of expressive
compositions. This approach aids in copyright scope determination by utilizing
the capabilities of GenAI to identify and prioritize expressive elements and
rank them according to their frequency in the model's dataset. The potential
implications of measuring expressive genericity for copyright law are profound.
Such scoring could assist courts in determining copyright scope during
litigation, inform the registration practices of Copyright Offices, allowing
registration of only highly original synthetic works, and help copyright owners
signal the value of their works and facilitate fairer licensing deals. More
generally, this approach offers valuable insights to policymakers grappling
with adapting copyright law to the challenges posed by the era of GenAI.

                                        <span>  Recent foundational language models have shown state-of-the-art performance
in many NLP tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. An advantage of these models
over more standard approaches based on fine-tuning is the ability to understand
instructions written in natural language (prompts), which helps them generalise
better to different tasks and domains without the need for specific training
data. This makes them suitable for addressing text classification problems for
domains with limited amounts of annotated instances. However, existing research
is limited in scale and lacks understanding of how text generation models
combined with prompting techniques compare to more established methods for text
classification such as fine-tuning masked language models. In this paper, we
address this research gap by performing a large-scale evaluation study for 16
text classification datasets covering binary, multiclass, and multilabel
problems. In particular, we compare zero- and few-shot approaches of large
language models to fine-tuning smaller language models. We also analyse the
results by prompt, classification type, domain, and number of labels. In
general, the results show how fine-tuning smaller and more efficient language
models can still outperform few-shot approaches of larger language models,
which have room for improvement when it comes to text classification.

                                        <span>  The large success of deep learning based methods in Visual Question Answering
(VQA) has concurrently increased the demand for explainable methods. Most
methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on generating
post-hoc explanations rather than taking an intrinsic approach, the latter
characterizing an interpretable model. In this work, we introduce an
interpretable approach for graph-based VQA and demonstrate competitive
performance on the GQA dataset. This approach bridges the gap between
interpretability and performance. Our model is designed to intrinsically
produce a subgraph during the question-answering process as its explanation,
providing insight into the decision making. To evaluate the quality of these
generated subgraphs, we compare them against established post-hoc
explainability methods for graph neural networks, and perform a human
evaluation. Moreover, we present quantitative metrics that correlate with the
evaluations of human assessors, acting as automatic metrics for the generated
explanatory subgraphs. Our implementation is available at

                                        <span>  End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) systems often suffer from
mistranscription of domain-specific phrases, such as named entities, sometimes
leading to catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. A family of fast and
lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models for ASR have recently been
proposed, which normally build on phonetic-level edit distance algorithms and
have shown impressive NEC performance. However, as the named entity (NE) list
grows, the problems of phonetic confusion in the NE list are exacerbated; for
example, homophone ambiguities increase substantially. In view of this, we
proposed a novel Description Augmented Named entity CorrEctoR (dubbed DANCER),
which leverages entity descriptions to provide additional information to
facilitate mitigation of phonetic confusion for NEC on ASR transcription. To
this end, an efficient entity description augmented masked language model
(EDA-MLM) comprised of a dense retrieval model is introduced, enabling MLM to
adapt swiftly to domain-specific entities for the NEC task. A series of
experiments conducted on the AISHELL-1 and Homophone datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our modeling approach. DANCER outperforms a strong baseline,
the phonetic edit-distance-based NEC model (PED-NEC), by a character error rate
(CER) reduction of about 7% relatively on AISHELL-1 for named entities. More
notably, when tested on Homophone that contain named entities of high phonetic
confusion, DANCER offers a more pronounced CER reduction of 46% relatively over
PED-NEC for named entities.

reference simplifications are scarce and costly. We propose to alleviate such
limitations by introducing REFeREE, a reference-free model-based metric with a
3-stage curriculum. REFeREE leverages an arbitrarily scalable pretraining stage
and can be applied to any quality standard as long as a small number of human
annotations are available. Our experiments show that our metric outperforms
existing reference-based metrics in predicting overall ratings and reaches
competitive and consistent performance in predicting specific ratings while
requiring no reference simplifications at inference time.

                                        <span>  Mixed initiative serves as one of the key factors in controlling conversation
directions. For a speaker, responding passively or leading proactively would
result in rather different responses. However, most dialogue systems focus on
training a holistic response generation model without any distinction among
different initiatives. It leads to the cross-contamination problem, where the
model confuses different initiatives and generates inappropriate responses.
Moreover, obtaining plenty of human annotations for initiative labels can be
expensive. To address this issue, we propose a general mix-Initiative Dynamic
Prefix Tuning framework (IDPT) to decouple different initiatives from the
generation model, which learns initiative-aware prefixes in both supervised and
unsupervised settings. Specifically, IDPT decouples initiative factors into
different prefix parameters and uses the attention mechanism to adjust the
selection of initiatives in guiding generation dynamically. The prefix
parameters can be tuned towards accurate initiative prediction as well as
mix-initiative response generation. Extensive experiments on two public
dialogue datasets show that the proposed IDPT outperforms previous baselines on
both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It also manages to generate
appropriate responses with manipulated initiatives.

                                        <span>  Labeling corpora constitutes a bottleneck to create models for new tasks or
domains. Large language models mitigate the issue with automatic corpus
labeling methods, particularly for categorical annotations. Some NLP tasks such
as emotion intensity prediction, however, require text regression, but there is
no work on automating annotations for continuous label assignments. Regression
is considered more challenging than classification: The fact that humans
perform worse when tasked to choose values from a rating scale lead to
comparative annotation methods, including best-worst scaling. This raises the
question if large language model-based annotation methods show similar
patterns, namely that they perform worse on rating scale annotation tasks than
on comparative annotation tasks. To study this, we automate emotion intensity
predictions and compare direct rating scale predictions, pairwise comparisons
and best-worst scaling. We find that the latter shows the highest reliability.
A transformer regressor fine-tuned on these data performs nearly on par with a
model trained on the original manual annotations.

relevant evidence from tables and text to answer questions. Previous studies in
table-text open-domain question answering have two common challenges: firstly,
their retrievers can be affected by false-positive labels in training datasets;
secondly, they may struggle to provide appropriate evidence for questions that
require reasoning across the table. To address these issues, we propose
Denoised Table-Text Retriever (DoTTeR). Our approach involves utilizing a
denoised training dataset with fewer false positive labels by discarding
instances with lower question-relevance scores measured through a false
positive detection model. Subsequently, we integrate table-level ranking
information into the retriever to assist in finding evidence for questions that
demand reasoning across the table. To encode this ranking information, we
fine-tune a rank-aware column encoder to identify minimum and maximum values
within a column. Experimental results demonstrate that DoTTeR significantly
outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval recall and downstream QA tasks.

user experience (UX) is often limited, leading to underuse, disengagement, and
abandonment. Co-designing interactions for VAs with potential end-users can be
useful. Crowdsourcing this process online and anonymously may add value.
However, most work has been done in the English-speaking West on dialogue data
sets. We must be sensitive to cultural differences in language, social
interactions, and attitudes towards technology. Our aims were to explore the
value of co-designing VAs in the non-Western context of Japan and demonstrate
the necessity of cultural sensitivity. We conducted an online elicitation study
(N = 135) where Americans (n = 64) and Japanese people (n = 71) imagined
dialogues (N = 282) and activities (N = 73) with future VAs. We discuss the
implications for coimagining interactions with future VAs, offer design
guidelines for the Japanese and English-speaking US contexts, and suggest
opportunities for cultural plurality in VA design and scholarship.

                                        <span>  Conversational Tree Search (V\"ath et al., 2023) is a recent approach to
controllable dialog systems, where domain experts shape the behavior of a
Reinforcement Learning agent through a dialog tree. The agent learns to
efficiently navigate this tree, while adapting to information needs, e.g.,
domain familiarity, of different users. However, the need for additional
training data hinders deployment in new domains. To address this, we explore
approaches to generate this data directly from dialog trees. We improve the
original approach, and show that agents trained on synthetic data can achieve
comparable dialog success to models trained on human data, both when using a
commercial Large Language Model for generation, or when using a smaller
open-source model, running on a single GPU. We further demonstrate the
scalability of our approach by collecting and testing on two new datasets:
ONBOARD, a new domain helping foreign residents moving to a new city, and the
medical domain DIAGNOSE, a subset of Wikipedia articles related to scalp and
head symptoms. Finally, we perform human testing, where no statistically
significant differences were found in either objective or subjective measures
between models trained on human and generated data.

                                        <span>  Since paraphrasing is an ill-defined task, the term "paraphrasing" covers
text transformation tasks with different characteristics. Consequently,
existing paraphrasing studies have applied quite different (explicit and
implicit) criteria as to when a pair of texts is to be considered a paraphrase,
all of which amount to postulating a certain level of semantic or lexical
similarity. In this paper, we conduct a literature review and propose a
taxonomy to organize the 25~identified paraphrasing (sub-)tasks. Using
classifiers trained to identify the tasks that a given paraphrasing instance
fits, we find that the distributions of task-specific instances in the known
paraphrase corpora vary substantially. This means that the use of these
corpora, without the respective paraphrase conditions being clearly defined
(which is the normal case), must lead to incomparable and misleading results.

projecting all languages in a shared space, but the translation quality is
undermined by the difference between languages in the text-only modality,
especially when the number of languages is large. To bridge this gap, we
introduce visual context as the universal language-independent representation
to facilitate multilingual translation. In this paper, we propose a framework
to leverage the multimodal prompt to guide the Multimodal Multilingual neural
Machine Translation (m3P), which aligns the representations of different
languages with the same meaning and generates the conditional vision-language
memory for translation. We construct a multilingual multimodal instruction
dataset (InstrMulti102) to support 102 languages. Our method aims to minimize
the representation distance of different languages by regarding the image as a
central language. Experimental results show that m3P outperforms previous
text-only baselines and multilingual multimodal methods by a large margin.
Furthermore, the probing experiments validate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing translation under the low-resource and massively multilingual
scenario.

  Large language models (LLMs) tend to learn the social and cultural biases
present in the raw pre-training data. To test if an LLM's behavior is fair,
functional datasets are employed, and due to their purpose, these datasets are
highly language and culture-specific. In this paper, we address a gap in the
scope of multilingual bias evaluation by presenting a bias detection dataset
specifically designed for the Russian language, dubbed as RuBia. The RuBia
dataset is divided into 4 domains: gender, nationality, socio-economic status,
and diverse, each of the domains is further divided into multiple fine-grained
subdomains. Every example in the dataset consists of two sentences with the
first reinforcing a potentially harmful stereotype or trope and the second
contradicting it. These sentence pairs were first written by volunteers and
then validated by native-speaking crowdsourcing workers. Overall, there are
nearly 2,000 unique sentence pairs spread over 19 subdomains in RuBia. To
illustrate the dataset's purpose, we conduct a diagnostic evaluation of
state-of-the-art or near-state-of-the-art LLMs and discuss the LLMs'
predisposition to social biases.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising in-context learning
abilities. However, conventional In-Context Learning (ICL) approaches are often
impeded by length limitations of transformer architecture, which pose
challenges when attempting to effectively integrate supervision from a
substantial number of demonstration examples. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, called Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE), to enable
existing LLMs to perform ICL with an increased number of demonstrations by
significantly expanding their context size. Importantly, this expansion does
not require fine-tuning or dependence on particular model architectures, all
the while preserving linear efficiency. NBCE initially splits the context into
equal-sized windows fitting the target LLM's maximum length. Then, it
introduces a voting mechanism to select the most relevant window, regarded as
the posterior context. Finally, it employs Bayes' theorem to generate the test
task. Our experimental results demonstrate that NBCE substantially enhances
performance, particularly as the number of demonstration examples increases,
consistently outperforming alternative methods. The NBCE code will be made
publicly accessible. The code NBCE is available at:

psychological traits of Operations Management (OM) and Supply Chain Management
(SCM) professionals. We use innovative methods and tools of text mining and
social network analysis to map the demand for relevant skills from a set of job
descriptions, with a focus on psychological characteristics. The proposed
approach aims to evaluate the market demand for specific traits by combining
relevant psychological constructs, text mining techniques, and an innovative
measure, namely, the Semantic Brand Score. We apply the proposed methodology to
a dataset of job descriptions for OM and SCM professionals, with the objective
of providing a mapping of their relevant required skills, including
psychological characteristics. In addition, the analysis is then detailed by
considering the region of the organization that issues the job description, its
organizational size, and the seniority level of the open position in order to
understand their nuances. Finally, topic modeling is used to examine key
components and their relative significance in job descriptions. By employing a
novel methodology and considering contextual factors, we provide an innovative
understanding of the attitudinal traits that differentiate professionals. This
research contributes to talent management, recruitment practices, and
professional development initiatives, since it provides new figures and
perspectives to improve the effectiveness and success of Operations Management
and Supply Chain Management professionals.

answering (VQA), often contain ambiguities caused by reliance on directive
information. This problem is exacerbated because some languages, such as
Japanese, often omit subjective or objective terms. Such ambiguities in
questions are often clarified by the contexts in conversational situations,
such as joint attention with a user or user gaze information. In this study, we
propose the Gaze-grounded VQA dataset (GazeVQA) that clarifies ambiguous
questions using gaze information by focusing on a clarification process
complemented by gaze information. We also propose a method that utilizes gaze
target estimation results to improve the accuracy of GazeVQA tasks. Our
experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the performance
in some cases of a VQA system on GazeVQA and identified some typical problems
of GazeVQA tasks that need to be improved.

Furthermore, in recent GEC evaluations, we have underscored the significance of
the LLMs scale and particularly emphasized the importance of fluency among

often rely on data-intensive deep learning models, limiting their practicality
for industry applications. Large language models on the other hand,
particularly instruction-tuned models (Instruct-LLMs), exhibit remarkable
zero-shot performance across various natural language tasks. This study
evaluates Instruct-LLMs on popular benchmark datasets for IC and SF,
emphasizing their capacity to learn from fewer examples. We introduce
ILLUMINER, an approach framing IC and SF as language generation tasks for
Instruct-LLMs, with a more efficient SF-prompting method compared to prior
work. A comprehensive comparison with multiple baselines shows that our
approach, using the FLAN-T5 11B model, outperforms the state-of-the-art joint
IC+SF method and in-context learning with GPT3.5 (175B), particularly in slot
filling by 11.1--32.2 percentage points. Additionally, our in-depth ablation
study demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning requires less than 6%
of training data to yield comparable performance with traditional full-weight
fine-tuning.

and difficult. Furthermore, while linguists typically use corpora to create
them, grammar descriptions often lack quantitative data. As for formal
grammars, they can be challenging to interpret. In this paper, we propose a new
method to extract and explore significant fine-grained grammar patterns and
potential syntactic grammar rules from treebanks, in order to create an
easy-to-understand corpus-based grammar. More specifically, we extract
descriptions and rules across different languages for two linguistic phenomena,
agreement and word order, using a large search space and paying special
attention to the ranking order of the extracted rules. For that, we use a
linear classifier to extract the most salient features that predict the
linguistic phenomena under study. We associate statistical information to each
rule, and we compare the ranking of the model's results to those of other
quantitative and statistical measures. Our method captures both well-known and
less well-known significant grammar rules in Spanish, French, and Wolof.

monolingual model. By employing the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, we
have achieved a successful scaling of the model's size to 5.7 billion
parameters. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of sentence
embedding and verified that the method outperforms the NLI-based prior
approach. Furthermore, we also have confirmed a positive correlation between
the size of the model and its performance. It was particularly noteworthy that
languages with fewer resources or those with less linguistic similarity to
English benefited more from the parameter increase. Our model is available at

                                        <span>  Recent research in provably secure neural linguistic steganography has
overlooked a crucial aspect: the sender must detokenize stegotexts to avoid
raising suspicion from the eavesdropper. The segmentation ambiguity problem,
which arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional
decoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on
these models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability
distribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably
secure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named
SyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We
group all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the
steganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among
ambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of
the sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator
(CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does
not change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and
thus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods. We
provide theoretical proofs and experimentally demonstrate the applicability of
our solution to various languages and models, showing its potential to
significantly improve the reliability and security of neural linguistic
steganography systems.

                                        <span>  Decoding continuous language from brain activity is a formidable yet
promising field of research. It is particularly significant for aiding people
with speech disabilities to communicate through brain signals. This field
addresses the complex task of mapping brain signals to text. The previous best
attempt reverse-engineered this process in an indirect way: it began by
learning to encode brain activity from text and then guided text generation by
aligning with predicted brain responses. In contrast, we propose a simple yet
effective method that guides text reconstruction by directly comparing them
with the predicted text embeddings mapped from brain activities. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art model, showing average improvements of 77% and 54% on BLEU and
METEOR scores. We further validate the proposed modules through detailed
ablation studies and case analyses and highlight a critical correlation: the
more precisely we map brain activities to text embeddings, the better the text
reconstruction results. Such insight can simplify the task of reconstructing
language from brain activities for future work, emphasizing the importance of
improving brain-to-text-embedding mapping techniques.

interested in achieving a successful outcome, but do also implicitly negotiate
the effort they put into the interaction (by adapting to each other). In this
work, we propose a challenging interactive reference game that requires two
players to coordinate on vision and language observations. The learning signal
in this game is a score (given after playing) that takes into account the
achieved goal and the players' assumed efforts during the interaction. We show
that a standard Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) setup achieves a high
success rate when bootstrapped with heuristic partner behaviors that implement
insights from the analysis of human-human interactions. And we find that a
pairing of neural partners indeed reduces the measured joint effort when
playing together repeatedly. However, we observe that in comparison to a
reasonable heuristic pairing there is still room for improvement -- which
invites further research in the direction of cost-sharing in collaborative
interactions.

                                        <span>  The method of training language models based on domain datasets has obtained
significant achievements in the task of generating scientific paper abstracts.
However, such models face problems of generalization and expensive training
costs. The use of large language models (LLMs) to solve the task of generating
paper abstracts saves the cost of model training. However, due to the
hallucination problem of LLM, it is often necessary to improve the reliability
of the results through multi-round query prompt approach such as Graph of
Thoughts (GoT), which also brings additional reasoning costs. In this paper, we
propose a Dynamic Graph of Thought (DGoT). It not only inherits the advantages
of the existing GoT prompt approach, but also dynamically adjust the graph
structure according to data characteristics while reducing model reasoning
cost. Experimental results show that our method's cost-effectiveness in
abstract generation tasks is only 43.7% to 56.4% of other multi-round query
prompt approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/JayceNing/DGoT.

contrastive learning and achieved promising results. However, by taking the
rest of the batch as negative samples without reviewing when forming
contrastive pairs, those studies encountered many suspicious and noisy negative
examples, significantly affecting the methods' overall performance. In this
work, we propose KDMCSE (Knowledge Distillation Multimodal contrastive learning
of Sentence Embeddings), a novel approach that enhances the discrimination and
generalizability of multimodal representation and inherits the knowledge from
the teacher model to learn the difference between positive and negative
instances and via that, can detect noisy and wrong negative samples effectively
before they are calculated in the contrastive objective. Furthermore, to
overcome the limitation of modeling the variation within negative pairs, we
introduce a new contrastive objective, AdapACSE (Adaptive Angular Margin
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal sentence embeddings), that
enhances the discriminative representation by strengthening the margin within
the angular space while capturing varying semantics within the negative.
Experimental results on widely used Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

demonstrated significant effectiveness in modeling long-range sequences.
However, It is unclear whether the success of S4 can be attributed to its
intricate parameterization and HiPPO initialization or simply due to State
Space Models (SSMs). To further investigate the potential of the deep SSMs, we
start with exponential smoothing (ETS), a simple SSM, and propose a stacked
architecture by directly incorporating it into an element-wise MLP. We augment
simple ETS with additional parameters and complex field to reduce the inductive
bias. Despite increasing less than 1\% of parameters of element-wise MLP, our
models achieve comparable results to S4 on the LRA benchmark.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) can make predictions using parametric
knowledge--knowledge encoded in the model weights--or contextual
knowledge--knowledge presented in the context. In many scenarios, a desirable
behavior is that LLMs give precedence to contextual knowledge when it conflicts
with the parametric knowledge, and fall back to using their parametric
knowledge when the context is irrelevant. This enables updating and correcting
the model's knowledge by in-context editing instead of retraining. Previous
works have shown that LLMs are inclined to ignore contextual knowledge and fail
to reliably fall back to parametric knowledge when presented with irrelevant
context. In this work, we discover that, with proper prompting methods,
instruction-finetuned LLMs can be highly controllable by contextual knowledge
and robust to irrelevant context. Utilizing this feature, we propose EREN (Edit
models by REading Notes) to improve the scalability and robustness of LLM
editing. To better evaluate the robustness of model editors, we collect a new
dataset, that contains irrelevant questions that are more challenging than the
ones in existing datasets. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Unlike existing techniques,
it can integrate knowledge from multiple edits, and correctly respond to
syntactically similar but semantically unrelated inputs (and vice versa). The

usage in various domains. Given the fact that psychiatric interviews are
goal-oriented and structured dialogues between the professional interviewer and
the interviewee, it is one of the most underexplored areas where LLMs can
contribute substantial value. Here, we explore the use of LLMs for enhancing
psychiatric interviews, by analyzing counseling data from North Korean
defectors with traumatic events and mental health issues. Specifically, we
investigate whether LLMs can (1) delineate the part of the conversation that
suggests psychiatric symptoms and name the symptoms, and (2) summarize
stressors and symptoms, based on the interview dialogue transcript. Here, the
transcript data was labeled by mental health experts for training and
evaluation of LLMs. Our experimental results show that appropriately prompted
LLMs can achieve high performance on both the symptom delineation task and the
summarization task. This research contributes to the nascent field of applying
LLMs to psychiatric interview and demonstrates their potential effectiveness in
aiding mental health practitioners.

(CGEC) task. Recent work using model ensemble methods based on voting can
effectively mitigate over-correction and improve the precision of the GEC
system. However, these methods still require the output of several GEC systems
and inevitably lead to reduced error recall. In this light, we propose the
LM-Combiner, a rewriting model that can directly modify the over-correction of
GEC system outputs without a model ensemble. Specifically, we train the model
on an over-correction dataset constructed through the proposed K-fold cross
inference method, which allows it to directly generate filtered sentences by
combining the original and the over-corrected text. In the inference stage, we
directly take the original sentences and the output results of other systems as
input and then obtain the filtered sentences through LM-Combiner. Experiments
on the FCGEC dataset show that our proposed method effectively alleviates the
over-correction of the original system (+18.2 Precision) while ensuring the
error recall remains unchanged. Besides, we find that LM-Combiner still has a
good rewriting performance even with small parameters and few training data,
and thus can cost-effectively mitigate the over-correction of black-box GEC
systems (e.g., ChatGPT).

                                        <span>  Accurate transcription of Bengali text to the International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA) is a challenging task due to the complex phonology of the language and
context-dependent sound changes. This challenge is even more for regional
Bengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for
these dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions
and phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an
approach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District
Guided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of
Bangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information
about the regional dialect or "district" of the input text before generating
the IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the
input sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic
patterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to
fine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving
superior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5. This
is attributed to ByT5's ability to handle a high percentage of
out-of-vocabulary words in the test set. The proposed approach highlights the
importance of incorporating regional dialect information into ubiquitous
natural language processing systems for languages with diverse phonological
variations. The following work was a result of the "Bhashamul" challenge, which
is dedicated to solving the problem of Bengali text with regional dialects to
IPA transcription https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/regipa/. The training and
inference notebooks are available through the competition link.

recognition (NER) focusing on extremely light supervision, consisting of a
lexicon containing only 10 examples per class. We introduce ELLEN, a simple,
fully modular, neuro-symbolic method that blends fine-tuned language models
with linguistic rules. These rules include insights such as ''One Sense Per
Discourse'', using a Masked Language Model as an unsupervised NER, leveraging
part-of-speech tags to identify and eliminate unlabeled entities as false
negatives, and other intuitions about classifier confidence scores in local and
global context. ELLEN achieves very strong performance on the CoNLL-2003
dataset when using the minimal supervision from the lexicon above. It also
outperforms most existing (and considerably more complex) semi-supervised NER
methods under the same supervision settings commonly used in the literature
(i.e., 5% of the training data). Further, we evaluate our CoNLL-2003 model in a
zero-shot scenario on WNUT-17 where we find that it outperforms GPT-3.5 and
achieves comparable performance to GPT-4. In a zero-shot setting, ELLEN also
achieves over 75% of the performance of a strong, fully supervised model
trained on gold data. Our code is available at:

                                        <span>  As AI becomes more integral in our lives, the need for transparency and
responsibility grows. While natural language explanations (NLEs) are vital for
clarifying the reasoning behind AI decisions, evaluating them through human
judgments is complex and resource-intensive due to subjectivity and the need
for fine-grained ratings. This study explores the alignment between ChatGPT and
human assessments across multiple scales (i.e., binary, ternary, and 7-Likert
scale). We sample 300 data instances from three NLE datasets and collect 900
human annotations for both informativeness and clarity scores as the text
quality measurement. We further conduct paired comparison experiments under
different ranges of subjectivity scores, where the baseline comes from 8,346
human annotations. Our results show that ChatGPT aligns better with humans in
more coarse-grained scales. Also, paired comparisons and dynamic prompting
(i.e., providing semantically similar examples in the prompt) improve the
alignment. This research advances our understanding of large language models'
capabilities to assess the text explanation quality in different configurations
for responsible AI development.

spoken language into text, with considerable applications in the clinical
realm, including streamlining medical transcription and integrating with
Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Nevertheless, challenges persist,
especially when transcriptions contain noise, leading to significant drops in
performance when Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are applied. Named
Entity Recognition (NER), an essential clinical task, is particularly affected
by such noise, often termed the ASR-NLP gap. Prior works have primarily studied
ASR's efficiency in clean recordings, leaving a research gap concerning the
performance in noisy environments. This paper introduces a novel dataset,
BioASR-NER, designed to bridge the ASR-NLP gap in the biomedical domain,
focusing on extracting adverse drug reactions and mentions of entities from the
Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) exam. Our dataset offers a
comprehensive collection of almost 2,000 clean and noisy recordings. In
addressing the noise challenge, we present an innovative transcript-cleaning
method using GPT4, investigating both zero-shot and few-shot methodologies. Our
study further delves into an error analysis, shedding light on the types of
errors in transcription software, corrections by GPT4, and the challenges GPT4
faces. This paper aims to foster improved understanding and potential solutions
for the ASR-NLP gap, ultimately supporting enhanced healthcare documentation
practices.

In FEVEROUS, existing works often rely on extensive preprocessing and utilize
rule-based transformations of data, leading to potential context loss or
misleading encodings. This paper introduces a simple yet powerful model that
nullifies the need for modality conversion, thereby preserving the original
evidence's context. By leveraging pre-trained models on diverse text and

our approach efficiently exploits latent connections between different data
types, thereby yielding comprehensive and reliable verdict predictions. The
model's modular structure adeptly manages multi-modal information, ensuring the
integrity and authenticity of the original evidence are uncompromised.
Comparative analyses reveal that our approach exhibits competitive performance,
aligning itself closely with top-tier models on the FEVEROUS benchmark.

retrieval-augmented Question-Answering (QA). Compared to the literature, CoA
overcomes two major challenges of current QA applications: (i) unfaithful
hallucination that is inconsistent with real-time or domain facts and (ii) weak
reasoning performance over compositional information. Our key contribution is a
novel reasoning-retrieval mechanism that decomposes a complex question into a
reasoning chain via systematic prompting and pre-designed actions.
Methodologically, we propose three types of domain-adaptable `Plug-and-Play'
actions for retrieving real-time information from heterogeneous sources. We
also propose a multi-reference faith score (MRFS) to verify and resolve
conflicts in the answers. Empirically, we exploit both public benchmarks and a
Web3 case study to demonstrate the capability of CoA over other methods.

                                        <span>  Entity matching is a critical challenge in data integration and cleaning,
central to tasks like fuzzy joins and deduplication. Traditional approaches
have focused on overcoming fuzzy term representations through methods such as
edit distance, Jaccard similarity, and more recently, embeddings and deep
neural networks, including advancements from large language models (LLMs) like
GPT. However, the core challenge in entity matching extends beyond term
fuzziness to the ambiguity in defining what constitutes a "match," especially
when integrating with external databases. This ambiguity arises due to varying
levels of detail and granularity among entities, complicating exact matches. We
propose a novel approach that shifts focus from purely identifying semantic
similarities to understanding and defining the "relations" between entities as
crucial for resolving ambiguities in matching. By predefining a set of
relations relevant to the task at hand, our method allows analysts to navigate
the spectrum of similarity more effectively, from exact matches to conceptually
related entities.

language models (LLMs) as part of encoders for biomedical imaging tasks, a
domain traditionally devoid of language or textual data. The approach diverges
from established methodologies by utilizing a frozen transformer block,
extracted from pre-trained LLMs, as an innovative encoder layer for the direct
processing of visual tokens. This strategy represents a significant departure
from the standard multi-modal vision-language frameworks, which typically hinge
on language-driven prompts and inputs. We found that these LLMs could boost
performance across a spectrum of biomedical imaging applications, including
both 2D and 3D visual classification tasks, serving as plug-and-play boosters.
More interestingly, as a byproduct, we found that the proposed framework
achieved superior performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on
extensive, standardized datasets in MedMNIST-2D and 3D. Through this work, we
aim to open new avenues for employing LLMs in biomedical imaging and enriching
the understanding of their potential in this specialized domain.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in generative AI have enabled ubiquitous access to large
language models (LLMs). Empowered by their exceptional capabilities to
understand and generate human-like text, these models are being increasingly
integrated into our society. At the same time, there are also concerns on the
potential misuse of this powerful technology, prompting defensive measures from
service providers. To overcome such protection, jailbreaking prompts have
recently emerged as one of the most effective mechanisms to circumvent security
restrictions and elicit harmful content originally designed to be prohibited.
  Due to the rapid development of LLMs and their ease of access via natural
languages, the frontline of jailbreak prompts is largely seen in online forums
and among hobbyists. To gain a better understanding of the threat landscape of
semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts, we systemized existing prompts and
measured their jailbreak effectiveness empirically. Further, we conducted a
user study involving 92 participants with diverse backgrounds to unveil the
process of manually creating jailbreak prompts. We observed that users often
succeeded in jailbreak prompts generation regardless of their expertise in
LLMs. Building on the insights from the user study, we also developed a system
using AI as the assistant to automate the process of jailbreak prompt
generation.

system research. While numerous English language multi-domain task-oriented
dialogue datasets have been developed and contributed to significant
advancements in task-oriented dialogue systems, such a dataset does not exist
in Japanese, and research in this area is limited compared to that in English.
In this study, towards the advancement of research and development of
task-oriented dialogue systems in Japanese, we constructed JMultiWOZ, the first
Japanese language large-scale multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset.
Using JMultiWOZ, we evaluated the dialogue state tracking and response
generation capabilities of the state-of-the-art methods on the existing major
English benchmark dataset MultiWOZ2.2 and the latest large language model
(LLM)-based methods. Our evaluation results demonstrated that JMultiWOZ
provides a benchmark that is on par with MultiWOZ2.2. In addition, through
evaluation experiments of interactive dialogues with the models and human
participants, we identified limitations in the task completion capabilities of
LLMs in Japanese.

                                        <span>  Second language acquisition (SLA) is a complex and dynamic process. Many SLA
studies that have attempted to record and analyze this process have typically
focused on a single modality (e.g., textual output of learners), covered only a
short period of time, and/or lacked control (e.g., failed to capture every
aspect of the learning process). In Project MOSLA (Moments of Second Language
Acquisition), we have created a longitudinal, multimodal, multilingual, and
controlled dataset by inviting participants to learn one of three target
languages (Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese) from scratch over a span of two years,
exclusively through online instruction, and recording every lesson using Zoom.
The dataset is semi-automatically annotated with speaker/language IDs and
transcripts by both human annotators and fine-tuned state-of-the-art speech
models. Our experiments reveal linguistic insights into learners' proficiency
development over time, as well as the potential for automatically detecting the
areas of focus on the screen purely from the unannotated multimodal data. Our
dataset is freely available for research purposes and can serve as a valuable
resource for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to SLA,
proficiency assessment, language and speech processing, pedagogy, and
multimodal learning analytics.

textual data. However, they are limited in dealing with multimodal datasets
(e.g., images and text). This paper presents the first systematic and
comprehensive evaluation of multimodal topic modeling of documents containing
both text and images. In the process, we propose two novel topic modeling
solutions and two novel evaluation metrics. Overall, our evaluation on an
unprecedented rich and diverse collection of datasets indicates that both of
our models generate coherent and diverse topics. Nevertheless, the extent to
which one method outperforms the other depends on the metrics and dataset
combinations, which suggests further exploration of hybrid solutions in the
future. Notably, our succinct human evaluation aligns with the outcomes
determined by our proposed metrics. This alignment not only reinforces the
credibility of our metrics but also highlights the potential for their
application in guiding future multimodal topic modeling endeavors.

especially hierarchical text classification (HTC), mainly focus on
self-supervised contrastive learning, extremely relying on human-designed
augmentation rules to generate contrastive samples, which can potentially
corrupt or distort the original information. In this paper, we tend to
investigate the feasibility of a contrastive learning scheme in which the
semantic and syntactic information inherent in the input sample is adequately
reserved in the contrastive samples and fused during the learning process.
Specifically, we propose an information lossless contrastive learning strategy
for HTC, namely \textbf{H}ierarchy-aware \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{L}ossless
contrastive \textbf{L}earning (HILL), which consists of a text encoder
representing the input document, and a structure encoder directly generating
the positive sample. The structure encoder takes the document embedding as
input, extracts the essential syntactic information inherent in the label
hierarchy with the principle of structural entropy minimization, and injects
the syntactic information into the text representation via hierarchical
representation learning. Experiments on three common datasets are conducted to
verify the superiority of HILL.

                                        <span>  Inspired by cognitive neuroscience studies, we introduce a novel `decoding
probing' method that uses minimal pairs benchmark (BLiMP) to probe internal
linguistic characteristics in neural language models layer by layer. By
treating the language model as the `brain' and its representations as `neural
activations', we decode grammaticality labels of minimal pairs from the
intermediate layers' representations. This approach reveals: 1) Self-supervised
language models capture abstract linguistic structures in intermediate layers
that GloVe and RNN language models cannot learn. 2) Information about syntactic
grammaticality is robustly captured through the first third layers of GPT-2 and
also distributed in later layers. As sentence complexity increases, more layers
are required for learning grammatical capabilities. 3) Morphological and
semantics/syntax interface-related features are harder to capture than syntax.
4) For Transformer-based models, both embeddings and attentions capture
grammatical features but show distinct patterns. Different attention heads
exhibit similar tendencies toward various linguistic phenomena, but with varied
contributions.

                                        <span>  The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has
sparked discussions on the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
However, replicating such advancements in open-source models has been
challenging. This paper introduces InternLM2, an open-source LLM that
outperforms its predecessors in comprehensive evaluations across 6 dimensions
and 30 benchmarks, long-context modeling, and open-ended subjective evaluations
through innovative pre-training and optimization techniques. The pre-training
process of InternLM2 is meticulously detailed, highlighting the preparation of
diverse data types including text, code, and long-context data. InternLM2
efficiently captures long-term dependencies, initially trained on 4k tokens
before advancing to 32k tokens in pre-training and fine-tuning stages,
exhibiting remarkable performance on the 200k ``Needle-in-a-Haystack" test.
InternLM2 is further aligned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a novel
Conditional Online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (COOL RLHF)
strategy that addresses conflicting human preferences and reward hacking. By
releasing InternLM2 models in different training stages and model sizes, we
provide the community with insights into the model's evolution.

                                        <span>  Within Dialogue Modeling research in AI and NLP, considerable attention has
been spent on ``dialogue state tracking'' (DST), which is the ability to update
the representations of the speaker's needs at each turn in the dialogue by
taking into account the past dialogue moves and history. Less studied but just
as important to dialogue modeling, however, is ``common ground tracking''
(CGT), which identifies the shared belief space held by all of the participants
in a task-oriented dialogue: the task-relevant propositions all participants
accept as true. In this paper we present a method for automatically identifying
the current set of shared beliefs and ``questions under discussion'' (QUDs) of
a group with a shared goal. We annotate a dataset of multimodal interactions in
a shared physical space with speech transcriptions, prosodic features,
gestures, actions, and facets of collaboration, and operationalize these
features for use in a deep neural model to predict moves toward construction of
common ground. Model outputs cascade into a set of formal closure rules derived
from situated evidence and belief axioms and update operations. We empirically
assess the contribution of each feature type toward successful construction of
common ground relative to ground truth, establishing a benchmark in this novel,
challenging task.

                                        <span>  Knowledge concept tagging for questions plays a crucial role in contemporary
intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis,
practice question recommendations, and course content organization.
Traditionally, these annotations have been conducted manually with help from
pedagogical experts, as the task requires not only a strong semantic
understanding of both question stems and knowledge definitions but also deep
insights into connecting question-solving logic with corresponding knowledge
concepts. In this paper, we explore automating the tagging task using Large
Language Models (LLMs), in response to the inability of prior manual methods to
meet the rapidly growing demand for concept tagging in questions posed by
advanced educational applications. Moreover, the zero/few-shot learning
capability of LLMs makes them well-suited for application in educational
scenarios, which often face challenges in collecting large-scale,
expertise-annotated datasets. By conducting extensive experiments with a
variety of representative LLMs, we demonstrate that LLMs are a promising tool
for concept tagging in math questions. Furthermore, through case studies
examining the results from different LLMs, we draw some empirical conclusions
about the key factors for success in applying LLMs to the automatic concept
tagging task.

models have as revolutionized the fields of NLP and computer vision
respectively. However, their slow inference, high computation and memory
requirement makes it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. In this study,
we propose a light-weight quantization aware fine tuning technique using
knowledge distillation (KD-QAT) to improve the performance of 4-bit weight
quantized LLMs using commonly available datasets to realize a popular language
use case, on device chat applications. To improve this paradigm of finetuning,
as main contributions, we provide insights into stability of KD-QAT by
empirically studying the gradient propagation during training to better
understand the vulnerabilities of KD-QAT based approaches to low-bit
quantization errors. Based on our insights, we propose ov-freeze, a simple
technique to stabilize the KD-QAT process. Finally, we experiment with the
popular 7B LLaMAv2-Chat model at 4-bit quantization level and demonstrate that
ov-freeze results in near float-point precision performance, i.e., less than
0.7% loss of accuracy on Commonsense Reasoning benchmarks.

domain experts and higher cost of employing them. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in data annotation tasks on
general domain datasets, their effectiveness on domain specific datasets
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate the potential of
LLMs as efficient data annotators for extracting relations in financial
documents. We compare the annotations produced by three LLMs (GPT-4, PaLM 2,
and MPT Instruct) against expert annotators and crowdworkers. We demonstrate
that the current state-of-the-art LLMs can be sufficient alternatives to
non-expert crowdworkers. We analyze models using various prompts and parameter
settings and find that customizing the prompts for each relation group by
providing specific examples belonging to those groups is paramount.
Furthermore, we introduce a reliability index (LLM-RelIndex) used to identify
outputs that may require expert attention. Finally, we perform an extensive
time, cost and error analysis and provide recommendations for the collection
and usage of automated annotations in domain-specific settings.

we showed human raters a variety of responses written by several models (GPT4
Turbo, Llama2, and Mistral), and had people rate these responses on how
empathic they seemed to be. We found that LLM-generated responses were
consistently rated as more empathic than human-written responses. Linguistic
analyses also show that these models write in distinct, predictable ``styles",
in terms of their use of punctuation, emojis, and certain words. These results
highlight the potential of using LLMs to enhance human peer support in contexts

                                        <span>  The high computational cost associated with pretraining large language models
limits their research. Two strategies have emerged to address this issue:
domain specialization and pretraining with high-quality data. To explore these
strategies, we specialized the Sabi\'a-2 Small model with 1.9 billion unique
tokens from reputable Brazilian legal sources and conducted few-shot
evaluations on legal and general knowledge exams. Our model, Juru, demonstrates
the benefits of domain specialization with a reduced amount of pretraining
data. However, this specialization comes at the expense of degrading
performance in other knowledge areas within the same language. This study
contributes to the growing body of scientific evidence showing that pretraining
data selection may enhance the performance of large language models, enabling
the exploration of these models at a lower cost.

opportunities to learn about digital technology, many on the margins of this
technology struggle to gain and maintain competency due to lexical or
conceptual barriers that prevent them from asking appropriate questions.
Although there have been many efforts to understand factuality of LLM-created
content and ability of LLMs to answer questions, it is not well understood how
unclear or nonstandard language queries affect the model outputs. We propose
the creation of a dataset that captures questions of digital newcomers and
outsiders, utilizing data we have compiled from a decade's worth of one-on-one
tutoring. In this paper we lay out our planned efforts and some potential uses
of this dataset.

families, are becoming increasingly capable of solving mathematical
quantitative reasoning problems. However, they still make unjustified logical
and computational errors in their reasoning steps and answers. In this paper,
we leverage the fact that if the training corpus of LLMs contained sufficiently
many examples of formal mathematics (e.g. in Isabelle, a formal theorem proving
environment), they can be prompted to translate i.e. autoformalize informal
mathematical statements into formal Isabelle code -- which can be verified
automatically for internal consistency. This provides a mechanism to
automatically reject solutions whose formalized versions are inconsistent
within themselves or with the formalized problem statement. We evaluate our
method on GSM8K, MATH and MultiArith datasets and demonstrate that our approach
provides a consistently better heuristic than vanilla majority voting -- the
previously best method to identify correct answers, by more than 12% on GSM8K.
In our experiments it improves results consistently across all datasets and LLM
model sizes. The code can be found at https://github.com/jinpz/dtv.

revolutionized various domains; however, their behavior in natural and
role-play conversation settings remains underexplored. In our study, we address
this gap by deeply investigating how ChatGPT behaves during conversations in
different settings by analyzing its interactions in both a normal way and a
role-play setting. We introduce a novel dataset of broad range of human-AI
conversations annotated with user motives and model naturalness to examine (i)
how humans engage with the conversational AI model, and (ii) how natural are AI
model responses. Our study highlights the diversity of user motives when
interacting with ChatGPT and variable AI naturalness, showing not only the
nuanced dynamics of natural conversations between humans and AI, but also
providing new avenues for improving the effectiveness of human-AI
communication.

and LLaMA, are increasingly prevalent. Numerous studies have explored effective
prompting techniques to harness the power of these LLMs for various research
problems. Retrieval, specifically in the legal data domain, poses a challenging
task for the direct application of Prompting techniques due to the large number
and substantial length of legal articles. This research focuses on maximizing
the potential of prompting by placing it as the final phase of the retrieval
system, preceded by the support of two phases: BM25 Pre-ranking and BERT-based
Re-ranking. Experiments on the COLIEE 2023 dataset demonstrate that integrating
prompting techniques on LLMs into the retrieval system significantly improves
retrieval accuracy. However, error analysis reveals several existing issues in
the retrieval system that still need resolution.

architectures - ViT, PVT, and Swin. These have worked to improve the attention
mechanism and make it more efficient. Differently, the need for including local
information was felt, leading to incorporating convolutions in transformers
such as CPVT and CvT. Global information is captured using a complex Fourier
basis to achieve global token mixing through various methods, such as AFNO,
GFNet, and Spectformer. We advocate combining three diverse views of data -
local, global, and long-range dependence. We also investigate the simplest
global representation using only the real domain spectral representation -
obtained through the Hartley transform. We use a convolutional operator in the
initial layers to capture local information. Through these two contributions,
we are able to optimize and obtain a spectral convolution transformer (SCT)
that provides improved performance over the state-of-the-art methods while
reducing the number of parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that
SCT-C-small gives state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset and
reaches 84.5\% top-1 accuracy, while SCT-C-Large reaches 85.9\% and SCT-C-Huge
reaches 86.4\%. We evaluate SCT on transfer learning on datasets such as
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flower, and Stanford Car. We also evaluate SCT on
downstream tasks i.e. instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. The project

                                        <span>  Recently, there have been significant advancements in large language models
(LLMs), particularly focused on the English language. These advancements have
enabled these LLMs to understand and execute complex instructions with
unprecedented accuracy and fluency. However, despite these advancements, there
remains a noticeable gap in the development of Chinese instruction tuning. The
unique linguistic features and cultural depth of the Chinese language pose
challenges for instruction tuning tasks. Existing datasets are either derived
from English-centric LLMs or are ill-suited for aligning with the interaction
patterns of real-world Chinese users. To bridge this gap, we introduce
COIG-CQIA, a high-quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset. Our aim is to
build a diverse, wide-ranging instruction-tuning dataset to better align model
behavior with human interactions. To this end, we collect a high-quality
human-written corpus from various sources on the Chinese Internet, including
Q&A communities, Wikis, examinations, and existing NLP datasets. This corpus
was rigorously filtered and carefully processed to form the COIG-CQIA dataset.
Furthermore, we train models of various scales on different subsets of CQIA,
following in-depth evaluation and analyses. The findings from our experiments
offer valuable insights for selecting and developing Chinese instruction-tuning
datasets. We also find that models trained on CQIA-Subset achieve competitive
results in human assessment as well as knowledge and security benchmarks. Data

                                        <span>  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on the quality
of prompts, which are often manually engineered and task-specific, making them
costly and non-scalable. We propose a novel approach, Supervisory Prompt
Training (SPT). SPT automates the generation of highly effective prompts using
a dual LLM system. In this system, one LLM, the generator, performs a task
while the other, the corrector, provides feedback and generates improved
prompts. In contrast to earlier techniques, both the generator and corrector
collaboratively and continuously improve their prompts over time. We also
introduce the concept of \textit{impact scores} to measure the sentence-level
effectiveness of the prompts. Our method was tested on four benchmarks, testing
the level of hallucinations in LLMs. Notably, we were able to increase the
accuracy of GPT-4 on GSM8K from 65.8\% to 94.1\% (28.3\% increase). SPT
advances LLMs by refining prompts to enhance performance and reduce
hallucinations, offering an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional
model fine-tuning.

pretraining, is the dominant method for unsupervised neural machine
translation. Theoretically, however, the method should not work in general. We
therefore conduct controlled experiments with artificial languages to determine
what properties of languages make back-translation an effective training
method, covering lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties. We find, contrary
to popular belief, that (i) parallel word frequency distributions, (ii)
partially shared vocabulary, and (iii) similar syntactic structure across
languages are not sufficient to explain the success of back-translation. We
show however that even crude semantic signal (similar lexical fields across
languages) does improve alignment of two languages through back-translation. We
conjecture that rich semantic dependencies, parallel across languages, are at
the root of the success of unsupervised methods based on back-translation.
Overall, the success of unsupervised machine translation was far from being
analytically guaranteed. Instead, it is another proof that languages of the
world share deep similarities, and we hope to show how to identify which of
these similarities can serve the development of unsupervised, cross-linguistic
tools.

                                        <span>  Adapting language models (LMs) to novel domains is often achieved through
fine-tuning a pre-trained LM (PLM) on domain-specific data. Fine-tuning
introduces new knowledge into an LM, enabling it to comprehend and efficiently
perform a target domain task. Fine-tuning can however be inadvertently
insensitive if it ignores the wide array of disparities (e.g in word meaning)
between source and target domains. For instance, words such as chronic and
pressure may be treated lightly in social conversations, however, clinically,
these words are usually an expression of concern. To address insensitive
fine-tuning, we propose Mask Specific Language Modeling (MSLM), an approach
that efficiently acquires target domain knowledge by appropriately weighting
the importance of domain-specific terms (DS-terms) during fine-tuning. MSLM
jointly masks DS-terms and generic words, then learns mask-specific losses by
ensuring LMs incur larger penalties for inaccurately predicting DS-terms
compared to generic words. Results of our analysis show that MSLM improves LMs
sensitivity and detection of DS-terms. We empirically show that an optimal
masking rate not only depends on the LM, but also on the dataset and the length
of sequences. Our proposed masking strategy outperforms advanced masking
strategies such as span- and PMI-based masking.

                                        <span>  Definition modelling (DM) is the task of automatically generating a
dictionary definition for a specific word. Computational systems that are
capable of DM can have numerous applications benefiting a wide range of
audiences. As DM is considered a supervised natural language generation
problem, these systems require large annotated datasets to train the machine
learning (ML) models. Several DM datasets have been released for English and
other high-resource languages. While Portuguese is considered a
mid/high-resource language in most natural language processing tasks and is
spoken by more than 200 million native speakers, there is no DM dataset
available for Portuguese. In this research, we fill this gap by introducing
DORE; the first dataset for Definition MOdelling for PoRtuguEse containing more
than 100,000 definitions. We also evaluate several deep learning based DM
models on DORE and report the results. The dataset and the findings of this
paper will facilitate research and study of Portuguese in wider contexts.

utility in developing supplementary health surveillance systems. In this study,
we present a new framework to surveil public health, focusing on mental health
(MH) outcomes. We hypothesize that locally posted tweets are indicative of
local MH outcomes and collect tweets posted from 765 neighborhoods (census
block groups) in the USA. We pair these tweets from each neighborhood with the
corresponding MH outcome reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to
create a benchmark dataset, LocalTweets. With LocalTweets, we present the first
population-level evaluation task for Twitter-based MH surveillance systems. We
then develop an efficient and effective method, LocalHealth, for predicting MH
outcomes based on LocalTweets. When used with GPT3.5, LocalHealth achieves the
highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.7429 and 79.78\%, respectively, a 59\%
improvement in F1-score over the GPT3.5 in zero-shot setting. We also utilize
LocalHealth to extrapolate CDC's estimates to proxy unreported neighborhoods,
achieving an F1-score of 0.7291. Our work suggests that Twitter data can be
effectively leveraged to simulate neighborhood-level MH outcomes.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens,
only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving
significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift
induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data
or poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and
scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and
replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully
re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss
and the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.
Specifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between
two commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\rightarrow$English) and a
stronger distribution shift (English$\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M
parameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of
tokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments,
we also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training
baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be
successfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies,
matching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute.
Finally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine
learning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming
and that are not bound to a fixed token budget.

extensive use in automatically detecting significant topics within a corpus of
documents. However, classic topic modelling approaches (e.g., LDA) have certain
drawbacks, such as the lack of semantic understanding and the presence of
overlapping topics. In this work, we investigate the untapped potential of
large language models (LLMs) as an alternative for uncovering the underlying
topics within extensive text corpora. To this end, we introduce a framework
that prompts LLMs to generate topics from a given set of documents and
establish evaluation protocols to assess the clustering efficacy of LLMs. Our
findings indicate that LLMs with appropriate prompts can stand out as a viable
alternative, capable of generating relevant topic titles and adhering to human
guidelines to refine and merge topics. Through in-depth experiments and
evaluation, we summarise the advantages and constraints of employing LLMs in
topic extraction.

incredible opportunities to increase work productivity and improve our lives.
Statisticians and data scientists have begun experiencing the benefits from the
availability of these tools in numerous ways, such as the generation of
programming code from text prompts to analyze data or fit statistical models.
One area that these tools can make a substantial impact is in research
discovery and summarization. Standalone tools and plugins to chatbots are being
developed that allow researchers to more quickly find relevant literature than
pre-2023 search tools. Furthermore, generative AI tools have improved to the
point where they can summarize and extract the key points from research
articles in succinct language. Finally, chatbots based on highly parameterized
LLMs can be used to simulate abductive reasoning, which provides researchers
the ability to make connections among related technical topics, which can also
be used for research discovery. We review the developments in AI and generative
AI for research discovery and summarization, and propose directions where these
types of tools are likely to head in the future that may be of interest to

                                        <span>  Open-domain question answering (QA) tasks usually require the retrieval of
relevant information from a large corpus to generate accurate answers. We
propose a novel approach called Generator-Retriever-Generator (GRG) that
combines document retrieval techniques with a large language model (LLM), by
first prompting the model to generate contextual documents based on a given
question. In parallel, a dual-encoder network retrieves documents that are
relevant to the question from an external corpus. The generated and retrieved
documents are then passed to the second LLM, which generates the final answer.
By combining document retrieval and LLM generation, our approach addresses the
challenges of open-domain QA, such as generating informative and contextually
relevant answers. GRG outperforms the state-of-the-art generate-then-read and
retrieve-then-read pipelines (GENREAD and RFiD) improving their performance by
at least by +5.2, +4.2, and +1.6 on TriviaQA, NQ, and WebQ datasets,
respectively. We provide code, datasets, and checkpoints at

                                        <span>  ChatGPT is another large language model (LLM) vastly available for the
consumers on their devices but due to its performance and ability to converse
effectively, it has gained a huge popularity amongst research as well as
industrial community. Recently, many studies have been published to show the
effectiveness, efficiency, integration, and sentiments of chatGPT and other
LLMs. In contrast, this study focuses on the important aspects that are mostly
overlooked, i.e. sustainability, privacy, digital divide, and ethics and
suggests that not only chatGPT but every subsequent entry in the category of
conversational bots should undergo Sustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and
Ethics (SPADE) evaluation. This paper discusses in detail the issues and
concerns raised over chatGPT in line with aforementioned characteristics. We
also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in accordance with the SPADE
evaluation. We support our hypothesis by some preliminary data collection and
visualizations along with hypothesized facts. We also suggest mitigations and
recommendations for each of the concerns. Furthermore, we also suggest some
policies and recommendations for AI policy act, if designed by the governments.

                                        <span>  The extraction of key information from receipts is a complex task that
involves the recognition and extraction of text from scanned receipts. This
process is crucial as it enables the retrieval of essential content and
organizing it into structured documents for easy access and analysis. In this
paper, we present AMuRD, a novel multilingual human-annotated dataset
specifically designed for information extraction from receipts. This dataset
comprises $47,720$ samples and addresses the key challenges in information
extraction and item classification - the two critical aspects of data analysis
in the retail industry. Each sample includes annotations for item names and
attributes such as price, brand, and more. This detailed annotation facilitates
a comprehensive understanding of each item on the receipt. Furthermore, the
dataset provides classification into $44$ distinct product categories. This
classification feature allows for a more organized and efficient analysis of
the items, enhancing the usability of the dataset for various applications. In
our study, we evaluated various language model architectures, e.g., by
fine-tuning LLaMA models on the AMuRD dataset. Our approach yielded exceptional
results, with an F1 score of 97.43\% and accuracy of 94.99\% in information
extraction and classification, and an even higher F1 score of 98.51\% and
accuracy of 97.06\% observed in specific tasks. The dataset and code are
publicly accessible for further
researchhttps://github.com/Update-For-Integrated-Business-AI/AMuRD.

developed on the paragraphs of a Hungarian literary journal to another. The aim
of the coding system is to track trends in the perception of literary
translation around the political transformation in 1989 in Hungary. To evaluate
not only task performance but also the consistence of the annotation, moreover,
to get better predictions from an ensemble, we use 10-fold crossvalidation.
Extensive hyperparameter tuning is used to obtain the best possible results and
fair comparisons. To handle label imbalance, we use loss functions and metrics
robust to it. Evaluation of the effect of domain shift is carried out by
sampling a test set from the target domain. We establish the sample size by
estimating the bootstrapped confidence interval via simulations. This way, we
show that our models can carry over one annotation system to the target domain.
Comparisons are drawn to provide insights such as learning multilabel
correlations and confidence penalty improve resistance to domain shift, and
domain adaptation on OCR-ed text on another domain improves performance almost
to the same extent as that on the corpus under study. See our code at

                                        <span>  Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe
preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise
localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually
annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of
current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy
video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands
significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain
irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written
by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique,
Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters
irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text
instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written
instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders
of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient
training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our
Sieve-\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step
localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model
is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance
in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a
fraction of the computational resources.

Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts,
specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external
sources. To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify
whether LLMs' responses, derived from the integration of generated and
retrieved contexts, are attributed to either generated or retrieved contexts.
To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets with
conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated and
retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer. Our
experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to
favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information. We
further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts
generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions,
increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process
used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their
full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs
merge diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for advancing current
augmentation methods for LLMs.

successful conversations than those who do not. Previous research has shown
that interlocutors entrain on linguistic features in both written and spoken
monolingual domains. More recent work on code-switched communication has also
shown preliminary evidence of entrainment on certain aspects of code-switching
(CSW). However, such studies of entrainment in code-switched domains have been
extremely few and restricted to human-machine textual interactions. Our work
studies code-switched spontaneous speech between humans, finding that (1)
patterns of written and spoken entrainment in monolingual settings largely
generalize to code-switched settings, and (2) some patterns of entrainment on
code-switching in dialogue agent-generated text generalize to spontaneous
code-switched speech. Our findings give rise to important implications for the
potentially "universal" nature of entrainment as a communication phenomenon,
and potential applications in inclusive and interactive speech technology.

growth of large language models. Compared to invasive-based signals which
require electrode implantation surgery, non-invasive neural signals (e.g. EEG,
MEG) have attracted increasing attention considering their safety and
generality. However, the exploration is not adequate in three aspects: 1)
previous methods mainly focus on EEG but none of the previous works address
this problem on MEG with better signal quality; 2) prior works have
predominantly used ``teacher-forcing" during generative decoding, which is
impractical; 3) prior works are mostly ``BART-based" not fully auto-regressive,
which performs better in other sequence tasks. In this paper, we explore the
brain-to-text translation of MEG signals in a speech-decoding formation. Here
we are the first to investigate a cross-attention-based ``whisper" model for
generating text directly from MEG signals without teacher forcing. Our model
achieves impressive BLEU-1 scores of 60.30 and 52.89 without pretraining \&
teacher-forcing on two major datasets (\textit{GWilliams} and
\textit{Schoffelen}). This paper conducts a comprehensive review to understand
how speech decoding formation performs on the neural decoding tasks, including
pretraining initialization, training \& evaluation set splitting, augmentation,
and scaling law.

                                        <span>  Hallucinations in vision-language models pose a significant challenge to
their reliability, particularly in the generation of long captions. Current
methods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these
hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel
unsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of
hallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated
tokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated
caption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image.
This semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of
token-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL
computes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity
of aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs
a proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes
hallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our
framework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2
by 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric. This improvement is achieved
solely through signals derived from the image itself, without the need for any
image-text pairs.

dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph.
Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees,
identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering
coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering
fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free
nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking
advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented
interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify
gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict
material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node
similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar
concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed
structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony,
highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In
another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite
based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's
'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set
of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity,
mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We
uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a
nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical
interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher
degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than
conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for
innovation by revealing hidden connections.

continues to rise, recent research efforts have pivoted towards developing
methodologies to edit implicit knowledge embedded within LLMs. Yet, there's
still a dark cloud lingering overhead -- will knowledge editing trigger
butterfly effect? since it is still unclear whether knowledge editing might
introduce side effects that pose potential risks or not. This paper pioneers
the investigation into the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing
for LLMs. To achieve this, we introduce new benchmark datasets and propose
innovative evaluation metrics. Our results underline two pivotal concerns: (1)
Knowledge Conflict: Editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify
the inherent inconsistencies in LLMs-a facet neglected by previous methods. (2)
Knowledge Distortion: Altering parameters with the aim of editing factual
knowledge can irrevocably warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs.
Experimental results vividly demonstrate that knowledge editing might
inadvertently cast a shadow of unintended consequences on LLMs, which warrant
attention and efforts for future works. Code and data are available at

Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Serbian, Macedonian, and Bulgarian,
covering thereby the whole spectrum of official languages in the South Slavic
language space. The collection of these corpora comprises a total of 13 billion
tokens of texts from 26 million documents. The comparability of the corpora is
ensured by a comparable crawling setup and the usage of identical crawling and
post-processing technology. All the corpora were linguistically annotated with
the state-of-the-art CLASSLA-Stanza linguistic processing pipeline, and
enriched with document-level genre information via the Transformer-based
multilingual X-GENRE classifier, which further enhances comparability at the
level of linguistic annotation and metadata enrichment. The genre-focused
analysis of the resulting corpora shows a rather consistent distribution of
genres throughout the seven corpora, with variations in the most prominent
genre categories being well-explained by the economic strength of each language
community. A comparison of the distribution of genre categories across the
corpora indicates that web corpora from less developed countries primarily
consist of news articles. Conversely, web corpora from economically more
developed countries exhibit a smaller proportion of news content, with a
greater presence of promotional and opinionated texts.

different minds yield superior outcomes compared to isolated individuals. In
this work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a
single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn
self-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist is an
intelligent agent that collaboratively combines multiple minds' strengths and
knowledge to enhance problem-solving in complex tasks. By dynamically
identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP
unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. Our in-depth analysis
shows that assigning multiple fine-grained personas in LLMs improves
problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of
personas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing,
Codenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing both
knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, such
as Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs,
experimental results demonstrate that SPP effectively reduces factual
hallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities. Additionally,
comparative experiments show that cognitive synergy only emerges in GPT-4 and
does not appear in less capable models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and
Llama2-13b-chat, which draws an interesting analogy to human development. Code,

parameter efficiency and overall performance across many language pairs via
complete multilingual parameter sharing. However, some language pairs in
multilingual models can see worse performance than in bilingual models,
especially in the one-to-many translation setting. Motivated by their empirical
differences, we examine the geometric differences in representations from
bilingual models versus those from one-to-many multilingual models.
Specifically, we compute the isotropy of these representations using intrinsic
dimensionality and IsoScore, in order to measure how the representations
utilize the dimensions in their underlying vector space. Using the same
evaluation data in both models, we find that for a given language pair, its
multilingual model decoder representations are consistently less isotropic and
occupy fewer dimensions than comparable bilingual model decoder
representations. Additionally, we show that much of the anisotropy in
multilingual decoder representations can be attributed to modeling
language-specific information, therefore limiting remaining representational

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in text summarization, particularly with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown remarkable performance. However, a
notable challenge persists as a substantial number of automatically-generated
summaries exhibit factual inconsistencies, such as hallucinations. In response
to this issue, various approaches for the evaluation of consistency for
summarization have emerged. Yet, these newly-introduced metrics face several
limitations, including lack of interpretability, focus on short document
summaries (e.g., news articles), and computational impracticality, especially
for LLM-based metrics. To address these shortcomings, we propose Factuality
Evaluation of summarization based on Natural language Inference and Claim
Extraction (FENICE), a more interpretable and efficient factuality-oriented
metric. FENICE leverages an NLI-based alignment between information in the
source document and a set of atomic facts, referred to as claims, extracted
from the summary. Our metric sets a new state of the art on AGGREFACT, the
de-facto benchmark for factuality evaluation. Moreover, we extend our
evaluation to a more challenging setting by conducting a human annotation
process of long-form summarization.

models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and
query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning.
This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that
bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and
query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of
fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose
Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the
appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the
proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc
document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction
task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation
and query-document relations.

outstanding performance in various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks. However, low-resource languages are still lagging behind current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) developments in the field of NLP due to insufficient
resources to train LLMs. Ethiopian languages exhibit remarkable linguistic
diversity, encompassing a wide array of scripts, and are imbued with profound
religious and cultural significance. This paper introduces EthioLLM --
multilingual large language models for five Ethiopian languages (Amharic,
Ge'ez, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya) and English, and Ethiobenchmark -- a
new benchmark dataset for various downstream NLP tasks. We evaluate the
performance of these models across five downstream NLP tasks. We open-source
our multilingual language models, new benchmark datasets for various downstream
tasks, and task-specific fine-tuned language models and discuss the performance
of the models. Our dataset and models are available at the
https://huggingface.co/EthioNLP repository.

writing assistants has become increasingly fragmented across various research
communities. We seek to address this challenge by proposing a design space as a
structured way to examine and explore the multidimensional space of intelligent
and interactive writing assistants. Through a large community collaboration, we
explore five aspects of writing assistants: task, user, technology,
interaction, and ecosystem. Within each aspect, we define dimensions (i.e.,
fundamental components of an aspect) and codes (i.e., potential options for
each dimension) by systematically reviewing 115 papers. Our design space aims
to offer researchers and designers a practical tool to navigate, comprehend,
and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid in the
envisioning and design of new writing assistants.

experts to master automated online content moderation. However, advancements in
this field require improved access to publicly available accurate and
non-synthetic datasets of social media content. For the Polish language, such
resources are very limited. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a
new open dataset of offensive social media content for the Polish language. The
dataset comprises content from Wykop.pl, a popular online service often
referred to as the "Polish Reddit", reported by users and banned in the
internal moderation process. It contains a total of 691,662 posts and comments,
evenly divided into two categories: "harmful" and "neutral" ("non-harmful").
The anonymized subset of the BAN-PL dataset consisting on 24,000 pieces (12,000
for each class), along with preprocessing scripts have been made publicly
available. Furthermore the paper offers valuable insights into real-life
content moderation processes and delves into an analysis of linguistic features
and content characteristics of the dataset. Moreover, a comprehensive
anonymization procedure has been meticulously described and applied. The
prevalent biases encountered in similar datasets, including post-moderation and
pre-selection biases, are also discussed.

                                        <span>  Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are major methods for solving
multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Many MOEAs have been proposed in
the past decades, of which the search operators need a carefully handcrafted
design with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace
the manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g.,
neural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing
and training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well
on new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel
approach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA
operators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM
serve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a
zero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further
design an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version
of decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO. Experimental studies on
different test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive
performance with widely used MOEAs. It is also promising to see the operator
only learned from a few instances can have robust generalization performance on
unseen problems with quite different patterns and settings. The results reveal
the potential benefits of using pre-trained LLMs in the design of MOEAs.To

                                        <span>  The technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a
commonly employed method to improve pre-trained Language Models (LM), enhancing
their ability to conform to human preferences. Nevertheless, the current
RLHF-based LMs necessitate full retraining each time novel queries or feedback
are introduced, which becomes a challenging task because human preferences can
vary between different domains or tasks. Retraining LMs poses practical
difficulties in many real-world situations due to the significant time and
computational resources required, along with concerns related to data privacy.
To address this limitation, we propose a new method called Continual Optimal
Policy Regularization (COPR), in which we compute the distribution of optimal
policy bypassing the partition function and then regularize the current policy
based on the historically optimal distribution to mitigate Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). COPR involves a single learning phase and doesn't necessitate
complex reinforcement learning. Importantly, it shares the capability with RLHF
to learn from unlabeled data by maintaining a scoring module, similar to reward
model, making it flexible for continually learning without human feedback. Our
experimental results show that COPR outperforms strong Continuous Learning (CL)
baselines when it comes to consistently aligning with human preferences on
incremental tasks and domains.

coherent topic sections and generate corresponding subheadings, unveiling the
discourse topic structure of a document. Compared with sentence-level topic
structure, the paragraph-level topic structure can quickly grasp and understand
the overall context of the document from a higher level, benefitting many
downstream tasks such as summarization, discourse parsing, and information
retrieval. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality Chinese
paragraph-level topic structure corpora restrained relative research and
applications. To fill this gap, we build the Chinese paragraph-level topic
representation, corpus, and benchmark in this paper. Firstly, we propose a
hierarchical paragraph-level topic structure representation with three layers
to guide the corpus construction. Then, we employ a two-stage man-machine
collaborative annotation method to construct the largest Chinese
Paragraph-level Topic Structure corpus (CPTS), achieving high quality. We also
build several strong baselines, including ChatGPT, to validate the
computability of CPTS on two fundamental tasks (topic segmentation and outline
generation) and preliminarily verified its usefulness for the downstream task
(discourse parsing).

grammar of Spanish implemented in the HPSG formalism. Such grammars encode a
complex set of hypotheses about syntax making them a resource for empirical
testing of linguistic theory. They also encode a strict notion of
grammaticality which makes them a resource for natural language processing
applications in computer-assisted language learning. This version of the SRG
uses the recent version of the Freeling morphological analyzer and is released
along with an automatically created, manually verified treebank of 2,291
sentences. We explain the treebanking process, emphasizing how it is different
from treebanking with manual annotation and how it contributes to
empirically-driven development of syntactic theory. The treebanks' high level
of consistency and detail makes them a resource for training high-quality
semantic parsers and generally systems that benefit from precise and detailed
semantics. Finally, we present the grammar's coverage and overgeneration on 100
sentences from a learner corpus, a new research line related to developing
methodologies for robust empirical evaluation of hypotheses in second language
acquisition.

                                        <span>  The task of text2motion is to generate human motion sequences from given
textual descriptions, where the model explores diverse mappings from natural
language instructions to human body movements. While most existing works are
confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions, e.g., "A man squats.",
fine-grained descriptions specifying movements of relevant body parts are
barely explored. Models trained with coarse-grained texts may not be able to
learn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives,
resulting in the failure to generate motions from unseen descriptions. In this
paper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset specializing in
fine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with
step-by-step instructions with pseudo-code compulsory checks. Accordingly, we
design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, making full use of
fine-grained textual information. Our quantitative evaluation shows that
FineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D improves FID by a large margin of
0.38, compared with competitive baselines. According to the qualitative
evaluation and case study, our model outperforms MotionDiffuse in generating
spatially or chronologically composite motions, by learning the implicit
mappings from fine-grained descriptions to the corresponding basic motions. We
release our data at https://github.com/KunhangL/finemotiondiffuse.

inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While
speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they
face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation
or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.
  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these
issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model
and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens
simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially
enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.
On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko
demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a
standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter
model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem
model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model
validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of
PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster
than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream
task accuracy.

                                        <span>  Interactions with virtual assistants typically start with a predefined
trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the
assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the
requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We
explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only
acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the
decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best
hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we
explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as
well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields
relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of
up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank
adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.

(LLMs) have gained impressive performance. However, the impact of each
component of the pretraining corpus remains opaque. As a result, the
organization of the pretraining corpus is still empirical and may deviate from
the optimal. To address this issue, we systematically analyze the impact of 48
datasets from 5 major categories of pretraining data of LLMs and measure their
impacts on LLMs using benchmarks about nine major categories of model
capabilities. Our analyses provide empirical results about the contribution of
multiple corpora on the performances of LLMs, along with their joint impact
patterns, including complementary, orthogonal, and correlational relationships.
We also identify a set of ``high-impact data'' such as Books that is
significantly related to a set of model capabilities. These findings provide
insights into the organization of data to support more efficient pretraining of
LLMs.

                                        <span>  Objective: To develop a high-throughput biomedical relation extraction system
that takes advantage of the large language models'(LLMs) reading comprehension
ability and biomedical world knowledge in a scalable and evidential manner.
Methods: We formulate the relation extraction task as binary classifications
for large language models. Specifically, LLMs make the decision based on the
external corpus and its world knowledge, giving the reason for the judgment for
factual verification. This method is tailored for semi-structured web articles,
wherein we designate the main title as the tail entity and explicitly
incorporate it into the context, and the potential head entities are matched
based on a biomedical thesaurus. Moreover, lengthy contents are sliced into
text chunks, embedded, and retrieved with additional embedding models. Results:
Using an open-source LLM, we extracted 248659 relation triplets of three
distinct relation types from three reputable biomedical websites. To assess the
efficacy of the basic pipeline employed for biomedical relation extraction, we
curated a benchmark dataset annotated by a medical expert. Evaluation results
indicate that the pipeline exhibits performance comparable to that of GPT-4.
Case studies further illuminate challenges faced by contemporary LLMs in the
context of biomedical relation extraction for semi-structured web articles.
Conclusion: The proposed method has demonstrated its effectiveness in
leveraging the strengths of LLMs for high-throughput biomedical relation
extraction. Its adaptability is evident, as it can be seamlessly extended to
diverse semi-structured biomedical websites, facilitating the extraction of
various types of biomedical relations with ease.

elections and climate change. We propose a simple and novel unsupervised method
to predict whether the authors of two posts agree or disagree, leveraging user
stances about named entities obtained from their posts. We present STEntConv, a
model which builds a graph of users and named entities weighted by stance and
trains a Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) to detect disagreement
between comment and reply posts. We run experiments and ablation studies and
show that including this information improves disagreement detection
performance on a dataset of Reddit posts for a range of controversial subreddit
topics, without the need for platform-specific features or user history.

information, they overlook phonetic information that is crucial for many tasks.
We develop three methods that use articulatory features to build phonetically
informed word embeddings. To address the inconsistent evaluation of existing
phonetic word embedding methods, we also contribute a task suite to fairly
evaluate past, current, and future methods. We evaluate both (1) intrinsic
aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation
with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and
cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote
reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research.

mathematical symbols vary vastly, presenting a complex challenge for large
language models (LLMs) that strive to achieve high performance across all three
domains simultaneously. Achieving a very high level of proficiency for an LLM
within a specific domain often requires extensive training with relevant
corpora, which is typically accompanied by a sacrifice in performance in other
domains. In this paper, we propose to fuse models that are already
highly-specialized directly. The proposed fusing framework, UltraFuser,
consists of three distinct specialists that are already sufficiently trained on
language, coding, and mathematics. A token-level gating mechanism is introduced
to blend the specialists' outputs. A two-stage training strategy accompanied by
balanced sampling is designed to ensure stability. To effectively train the
fused model, we further construct a high-quality supervised instruction tuning
dataset, UltraChat 2, which includes text, code, and mathematical content. This
dataset comprises approximately 300,000 instructions and covers a wide range of
topics in each domain. Experiments show that our model could simultaneously
achieve mastery of the three crucial domains.

transformer-based models that produce sentence embeddings with self-contrastive

Longfomer-based document encoders using a state-of-the-art unsupervised
contrastive learning method (SimCSE). Further on, we complement the baseline
method -- siamese neural network -- with additional convex neural networks
based on functional Bregman divergence aiming to enhance the quality of the
output document representations. We show that overall the combination of a
self-contrastive siamese network and our proposed neural Bregman network
outperforms the baselines in two linear classification settings on three long
document topic classification tasks from the legal and biomedical domains.

                                        <span>  In this study, we propose to evaluate the use of deep learning methods for
semantic classification at the sentence level to accelerate the process of
corpus building in the field of humanities and linguistics, a traditional and
time-consuming task. We introduce a novel corpus comprising around 2500
sentences spanning from 300 BCE to 900 CE including sexual semantics (medical,
erotica, etc.). We evaluate various sentence classification approaches and
different input embedding layers, and show that all consistently outperform
simple token-based searches. We explore the integration of idiolectal and
sociolectal metadata embeddings (centuries, author, type of writing), but find
that it leads to overfitting. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach, achieving high precision and true positive rates (TPR) of
respectively 70.60% and 86.33% using HAN. We evaluate the impact of the dataset
size on the model performances (420 instead of 2013), and show that, while our
models perform worse, they still offer a high enough precision and TPR, even
without MLM, respectively 69% and 51%. Given the result, we provide an analysis
of the attention mechanism as a supporting added value for humanists in order
to produce more data.

                                        <span>  This work revisits the topic of jointly parsing constituency and dependency
trees, i.e., to produce compatible constituency and dependency trees
simultaneously for input sentences, which is attractive considering that the
two types of trees are complementary in representing syntax. The original work
of Zhou and Zhao (2019) performs joint parsing only at the inference phase.
They train two separate parsers under the multi-task learning framework (i.e.,
one shared encoder and two independent decoders). They design an ad-hoc dynamic
programming-based decoding algorithm of $O(n^5)$ time complexity for finding
optimal compatible tree pairs. Compared to their work, we make progress in
three aspects: (1) adopting a much more efficient decoding algorithm of
$O(n^4)$ time complexity, (2) exploring joint modeling at the training phase,
instead of only at the inference phase, (3) proposing high-order scoring
components to promote constituent-dependency interaction. We conduct
experiments and analysis on seven languages, covering both rich-resource and
low-resource scenarios. Results and analysis show that joint modeling leads to
a modest overall performance boost over separate modeling, but substantially
improves the complete matching ratio of whole trees, thanks to the explicit
modeling of tree compatibility.

examining the available evidence. High-quality evidence plays a vital role in
enhancing fact-checking systems and facilitating the generation of explanations
that are understandable to humans. However, the provision of both sufficient
and relevant evidence for explainable fact-checking systems poses a challenge.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a method based on a Large Language Model
to automatically retrieve and summarize evidence from the Web. Furthermore, we
construct RU22Fact, a novel multilingual explainable fact-checking dataset on
the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 of 16K samples, each containing real-world
claims, optimized evidence, and referenced explanation. To establish a baseline
for our dataset, we also develop an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system
to verify claims and generate explanations. Experimental results demonstrate
the prospect of optimized evidence in increasing fact-checking performance and
also indicate the possibility of further progress in the end-to-end claim
verification and explanation generation tasks.

                                        <span>  Socioeconomic bias in society exacerbates disparities, influencing access to
opportunities and resources based on individuals' economic and social
backgrounds. This pervasive issue perpetuates systemic inequalities, hindering
the pursuit of inclusive progress as a society. In this paper, we investigate
the presence of socioeconomic bias, if any, in large language models. To this
end, we introduce a novel dataset SilverSpoon, consisting of 3000 samples that
illustrate hypothetical scenarios that involve underprivileged people
performing ethically ambiguous actions due to their circumstances, and ask
whether the action is ethically justified. Further, this dataset has a
dual-labeling scheme and has been annotated by people belonging to both ends of
the socioeconomic spectrum. Using SilverSpoon, we evaluate the degree of
socioeconomic bias expressed in large language models and the variation of this
degree as a function of model size. We also perform qualitative analysis to
analyze the nature of this bias. Our analysis reveals that while humans
disagree on which situations require empathy toward the underprivileged, most
large language models are unable to empathize with the socioeconomically
underprivileged regardless of the situation. To foster further research in this
domain, we make SilverSpoon and our evaluation harness publicly available.

                                        <span>  We evaluated 20+ Transformer models for ranking of long documents (including
recent LongP models trained with FlashAttention) and compared them with simple
FirstP baselines (applying the same model to input truncated to the first 512
tokens). We used MS MARCO Documents v1 as a primary training set and evaluated
models in the zero-shot scenario as well as after fine-tuning on other
collections.
  In our initial experiments with standard collections we found that
long-document models underperformed FirstP or outperformed it by at most 5% on
average in terms of MRR or NDCG. We then conjectured that this was not due to
models inability to process long context but rather due to a positional bias of
relevant passages, which tended to be among the first 512 document tokens. We
found evidence that this bias was, indeed, present in at least two test sets,
which motivated us to create a new collection MS MARCO FarRelevant where the
relevant passages were not present among the first 512 tokens.
  Unlike standard collections where we observed both little benefit from
incorporating longer contexts and limited variability in model performance
(within a few %), experiments on MS MARCO FarRelevant uncovered dramatic
differences among models. FirstP models performed roughly at the
random-baseline level in both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. Simple
aggregation models (e.g., MaxP) had good zero-shot accuracy but benefited
little from fine-tuning. Most other models had poor zero-shot performance
(sometimes at a random baseline level) but outstripped MaxP by as much 13-28\%
after finetuning. Thus, positional bias not only diminishes benefits of
processing longer document contexts but also leads to model overfitting to this
bias and performing poorly in a zero-shot setting when a distribution of
relevant passages changes substantially.
  We make our software and MS MARCO FarRelevant available.

many real-world natural language processing tasks such as Topic Detection and
Tracking (TDT). TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event,
and in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have
been written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes
this into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the
semantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are
likely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie
release may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method
that fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of
news documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document
embeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into
downstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets
in English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the
time-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the
News2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder
to an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can
benefit the overall performance. We conduct ablation studies on the time
representation and fusion algorithm strategies, showing that our proposed model
outperforms alternative strategies. Finally, we probe the model to examine how
it handles recurring events more effectively than previous TDT systems.

                                        <span>  Safety lies at the core of the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).
There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences,
including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement
learning from human feedback, and red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover
that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which
are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework
CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment
to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with
LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot
enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs,
including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across
11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that
certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment
of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing
safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem
to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role
play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability.
SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases.

                                        <span>  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from
"prompt bias" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce
biases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in
assessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to
improve the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and
mitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit
non-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt
displaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify
benchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on
imbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a
representation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference
time. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using
prompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal
representations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to
produce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,
and benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted
performance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt
retrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results
indicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge
evaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.
Hopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen
PLMs toward reliable knowledge bases. Code and data are released in

strong hypothesis is a best guess based on existing evidence and informed by a
comprehensive view of relevant literature. However, with exponential increase
in the number of scientific articles published annually, manual aggregation and
synthesis of evidence related to a given hypothesis is a challenge. Our work
explores the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to discern
evidence in support or refute of specific hypotheses based on the text of

                                        <span>  Recent compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) methods adapt pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) by constructing trainable prompts only for
composed state-object pairs. Relying on learning the joint representation of
seen compositions, these methods ignore the explicit modeling of the state and
object, thus limiting the exploitation of pre-trained knowledge and
generalization to unseen compositions. With a particular focus on the
universality of the solution, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for
CZSL models that establishes three identification branches (i.e., Multi-Path)
to jointly model the state, object, and composition. The presented Troika is
our implementation that aligns the branch-specific prompt representations with
decomposed visual features. To calibrate the bias between semantically similar
multi-modal representations, we further devise a Cross-Modal Traction module
into Troika that shifts the prompt representation towards the current visual
content. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks, where
our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both closed-world and
open-world settings. The code will be available at

significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and
utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new
collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under
development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively
references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for
collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a
comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information;
second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries
enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe
the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to
assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of
prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and
accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain,
which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures
efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility
for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This
innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast
datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering
researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to
explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.

intelligent agents have been fraught with challenges that compromise their
efficiency and efficacy. Among these issues are sub-optimal scheduling and
resource allocation of agent requests over the LLM, the difficulties in
maintaining context during interactions between agent and LLM, and the
complexities inherent in integrating heterogeneous agents with different
capabilities and specializations. The rapid increase of agent quantity and
complexity further exacerbates these issues, often leading to bottlenecks and
sub-optimal utilization of resources. Inspired by these challenges, this paper
presents AIOS, an LLM agent operating system, which embeds large language model
into operating systems (OS) as the brain of the OS, enabling an operating
system "with soul" -- an important step towards AGI. Specifically, AIOS is
designed to optimize resource allocation, facilitate context switch across
agents, enable concurrent execution of agents, provide tool service for agents,
and maintain access control for agents. We present the architecture of such an
operating system, outline the core challenges it aims to resolve, and provide
the basic design and implementation of the AIOS. Our experiments on concurrent
execution of multiple agents demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of our

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities as
automatic evaluators in assessing the quality of generated natural language.
However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate
coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first
conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human
judgement, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating
biases are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by
the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking
problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PairS), an uncertainty-guided
search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons and efficiently
ranks candidate texts. PairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
representative evaluation tasks and demonstrates significant improvements over
direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise
preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PairS
benefits from calibration.

Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data,
treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide
a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research
articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how
LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI
areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record
management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review
identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major
developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical
concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy
and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could
further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and
patient outcomes. This bibliometric review serves as a resource for
stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and
policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in

astonishing success of ChatGPT and other systems based on large language models
(LLMs). After such a disruptive change to our understanding of the field, what
is left to do? Taking a historical lens, we look for guidance from the first
era of LLMs, which began in 2005 with large $n$-gram models for machine
translation (MT). We identify durable lessons from the first era, and more
importantly, we identify evergreen problems where NLP researchers can continue
to make meaningful contributions in areas where LLMs are ascendant. We argue
that disparities in scale are transient and researchers can work to reduce
them; that data, rather than hardware, is still a bottleneck for many
applications; that meaningful realistic evaluation is still an open problem;
and that there is still room for speculative approaches.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in large language models have showcased their remarkable
generalizability across various domains. However, their reasoning abilities
still have significant room for improvement, especially when confronted with
scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning. Although large language models
possess extensive knowledge, their reasoning often fails to effectively utilize
this knowledge to establish a coherent thinking paradigm. These models
sometimes show hallucinations as their reasoning procedures are unconstrained
by logical principles. Aiming at improving the zero-shot chain-of-thought
reasoning ability of large language models, we propose LoT (Logical Thoughts),
a self-improvement prompting framework that leverages principles rooted in
symbolic logic, particularly Reductio ad Absurdum, to systematically verify and
rectify the reasoning processes step by step. Experimental evaluations
conducted on language tasks in diverse domains, including arithmetic,
commonsense, symbolic, causal inference, and social problems, demonstrate the
efficacy of enhanced reasoning by logic. The implementation code for LoT can be
accessed at: https://github.com/xf-zhao/LoT.

capacities in comprehending and producing language. However, their internal
workings remain a black box, and it is unclear whether LLMs and chatbots can
develop humanlike characteristics in language use. Cognitive scientists have
devised many experiments that probe, and have made great progress in
explaining, how people comprehend and produce language. We subjected ChatGPT
and Vicuna to 12 of these experiments ranging from sounds to dialogue,
preregistered and with 1000 runs (i.e., iterations) per experiment. ChatGPT and
Vicuna replicated the human pattern of language use in 10 and 7 out of the 12
experiments, respectively. The models associated unfamiliar words with
different meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently
encountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures,
attributed causality as a function of verb semantics, and accessed different
meanings and retrieved different words depending on an interlocutor's identity.
In addition, ChatGPT, but not Vicuna, nonliterally interpreted implausible
sentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, drew reasonable
inferences, and overlooked semantic fallacies in a sentence. Finally, unlike
humans, neither model preferred using shorter words to convey less informative
content, nor did they use context to resolve syntactic ambiguities. We discuss
how these convergences and divergences may result from the transformer
architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLMs such as ChatGPT
(and Vicuna to a lesser extent) are humanlike in many aspects of human language
processing.

explain and control an LLM's reasoning process is key for reliability,
transparency, and future model developments. We propose SelfIE
(Self-Interpretation of Embeddings), a framework that enables LLMs to interpret
their own embeddings in natural language by leveraging their ability to respond
to inquiries about a given passage. Capable of interpreting open-world concepts
in the hidden embeddings, SelfIE reveals LLM internal reasoning in cases such
as making ethical decisions, internalizing prompt injection, and recalling
harmful knowledge. SelfIE's text descriptions on hidden embeddings also open up
new avenues to control LLM reasoning. We propose Supervised Control, which
allows editing open-ended concepts while only requiring gradient computation of
individual layer. We extend RLHF to hidden embeddings and propose Reinforcement
Control that erases harmful knowledge in LLM without supervision targets.

Portuguese texts. The models are evaluated on a diverse range of exams,
including entry-level tests for Brazilian universities, professional
certification exams, and graduate-level exams for various disciplines such as
accounting, economics, engineering, law and medicine. Our results reveal that
our best model so far, Sabi\'a-2 Medium, matches or surpasses GPT-4's
performance in 23 out of 64 exams and outperforms GPT-3.5 in 58 out of 64
exams. Notably, specialization has a significant impact on a model's
performance without the need to increase its size, allowing us to offer
Sabi\'a-2 Medium at a price per token that is 10 times cheaper than GPT-4.
Finally, we identified that math and coding are key abilities that need
improvement.

generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that
state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are
generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly
benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct
instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel
framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE).
Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward
function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable
diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences
based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the
limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward
dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the
performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical
experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over
previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large
margin.

redirected to more nuanced aspects, intricate phenomena, as well as potential
risks that may arise from the widespread use of MT tools. Along this line, this
paper offers a meticulous assessment of three commercial MT systems - Google
Translate, DeepL, and Modern MT - with a specific focus on gender translation

revealing significant discrepancies in the gender translation of the three
systems, with each system displaying varying degrees of bias despite their

foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby
reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous
advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global
user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific
adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios
requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To
mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which
each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank
adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests.
We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA,
showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark
spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6
languages.

manually annotated lexicons created by human experts to extract sentiment from
financial texts. Although lexicon-based methods are simple to implement and
fast to operate on textual data, they require considerable manual annotation
efforts to create, maintain, and update the lexicons. These methods are also
considered inferior to the deep learning-based approaches, such as transformer
models, which have become dominant in various NLP tasks due to their remarkable
performance. However, transformers require extensive data and computational
resources for both training and testing. Additionally, they involve significant
prediction times, making them unsuitable for real-time production environments
or systems with limited processing capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a
novel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the
advantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models. We propose an
approach that utilizes transformers and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
for explainability to learn financial lexicons. Our study presents four main
contributions. Firstly, we demonstrate that transformer-aided explainable
lexicons can enhance the vocabulary coverage of the benchmark Loughran-McDonald
(LM) lexicon, reducing the human involvement in annotating, maintaining, and
updating the lexicons. Secondly, we show that the resulting lexicon outperforms
the standard LM lexicon in SA of financial datasets. Thirdly, we illustrate
that the lexicon-based approach is significantly more efficient in terms of
model speed and size compared to transformers. Lastly, the XLex approach is
inherently more interpretable than transformer models as lexicon models rely on
predefined rules, allowing for better insights into the results of SA and
making the XLex approach a viable tool for financial decision-making.

into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF)
post-question. The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence
scores before and after each question. The experimental findings were analyzed
using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF

                                        <span>  Incorporating human context into language models is the next frontier for
human-centered natural language processing. Currently, two pre-training methods
exist: group-wise attributes (e.g., over-45-year-olds) or individual traits.
Group attributes are coarse -- not all 45-year-olds write the same way -- while
modeling individual traits allows for a more personalized representation, but
requires more complex modeling and data. So far, it is unclear which
pre-training approach benefits what tasks. We compare pre-training models with
human context via 1) group attributes, 2) individual users, and 3) a combined
approach on 5 user- and document-level tasks. We find that pre-training with
both group and individual features significantly improves the two user-level
regression tasks like age estimation and personality assessment. Pre-training
on individual users significantly improves the three document-level
classification tasks like stance and topic detection. It even does well for
downstream tasks without historical user data. Our results suggest both
approaches have specific use cases, opening new avenues for human-centered
language modeling.

memory-intensive. Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference.
However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at
the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving,
and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit
weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that
weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the
activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from
activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation.
SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for
all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG,
Llama-1/2, Falcon, Mistral, and Mixtral models. We demonstrate up to 1.56x
speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy.
SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a
turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs. Code is

realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately
expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)
has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale
solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already
been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the
extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,
assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive
impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application
to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks.
The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible
development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical
is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance
mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including
those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all
stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will
minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs
will positively impact mental health globally.

method for Language Model (LM) alignment. However, RLHF is an unstable and
data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated
data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new
class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any
pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single
action, A-LoL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed
scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM's value estimate, A-LoL
only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient
to noise. Overall, A-LoL is an easy-to-implement, sample-efficient, and stable
LM training recipe.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LoL and its variants with a set of four
different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO)
and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL
baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant
(HHA), LMs trained with A-LoL methods achieve the highest diversity while also
being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans.
Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LoL could optimize multiple
distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.
  We also release our experimental code. https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL

of current code language models. Compared to previous models that primarily
employ bimodal and unimodal pairs extracted from CodeSearchNet for
pre-training, our model exhibits significant performance improvements across a

                                        <span>  The proliferation of online toxic speech is a pertinent problem posing
threats to demographic groups. While explicit toxic speech contains offensive
lexical signals, implicit one consists of coded or indirect language.
Therefore, it is crucial for models not only to detect implicit toxic speech
but also to explain its toxicity. This draws a unique need for unified
frameworks that can effectively detect and explain implicit toxic speech. Prior
works mainly formulated the task of toxic speech detection and explanation as a
text generation problem. Nonetheless, models trained using this strategy can be
prone to suffer from the consequent error propagation problem. Moreover, our
experiments reveal that the detection results of such models are much lower
than those that focus only on the detection task. To bridge these gaps, we
introduce ToXCL, a unified framework for the detection and explanation of
implicit toxic speech. Our model consists of three modules: a (i) Target Group
Generator to generate the targeted demographic group(s) of a given post; an
(ii) Encoder-Decoder Model in which the encoder focuses on detecting implicit

                                        <span>  Bragging is the act of uttering statements that are likely to be positively
viewed by others and it is extensively employed in human communication with the
aim to build a positive self-image of oneself. Social media is a natural
platform for users to employ bragging in order to gain admiration, respect,
attention and followers from their audiences. Yet, little is known about the
scale of bragging online and its characteristics. This paper employs
computational sociolinguistics methods to conduct the first large scale study
of bragging behavior on Twitter (U.S.) by focusing on its overall prevalence,
temporal dynamics and impact of demographic factors. Our study shows that the
prevalence of bragging decreases over time within the same population of users.
In addition, younger, more educated and popular users in the U.S. are more
likely to brag. Finally, we conduct an extensive linguistics analysis to unveil
specific bragging themes associated with different user traits.

                                        <span>  Fact-checking is the task of verifying the factuality of a given claim by
examining the available evidence. High-quality evidence plays a vital role in
enhancing fact-checking systems and facilitating the generation of explanations
that are understandable to humans. However, the provision of both sufficient
and relevant evidence for explainable fact-checking systems poses a challenge.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a method based on a Large Language Model
to automatically retrieve and summarize evidence from the Web. Furthermore, we
construct RU22Fact, a novel multilingual explainable fact-checking dataset on
the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 of 16K samples, each containing real-world
claims, optimized evidence, and referenced explanation. To establish a baseline
for our dataset, we also develop an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system
to verify claims and generate explanations. Experimental results demonstrate
the prospect of optimized evidence in increasing fact-checking performance and
also indicate the possibility of further progress in the end-to-end claim
verification and explanation generation tasks.

Text documents are created either in digital native platforms or through the
conversion of other media files such as images and speech. While the digital
native text is invariably obtained through physical or virtual keyboards,
technologies such as OCR and speech recognition are utilized to transform the
images and speech signals into text content. All these variety of mechanisms of
text generation also introduce errors into the captured text.
  This project aims at analyzing different kinds of error that occurs in text
documents. The work employs two of the advanced deep neural network-based
language models, namely, BART and MarianMT, to rectify the anomalies present in
the text. Transfer learning of these models with available dataset is performed
to finetune their capacity for error correction. A comparative study is
conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these models in handling each of
the defined error categories. It is observed that while both models can bring
down the erroneous sentences by 20+%, BART can handle spelling errors far
better (24.6%) than grammatical errors (8.8%).

                                        <span>  This paper makes two contributions to the field of text-based patent
similarity. First, it compares the performance of different kinds of
patent-specific pretrained embedding models, namely static word embeddings
(such as word2vec and doc2vec models) and contextual word embeddings (such as
transformers based models), on the task of patent similarity calculation.
Second, it compares specifically the performance of Sentence Transformers
(SBERT) architectures with different training phases on the patent similarity
task. To assess the models' performance, we use information about patent
interferences, a phenomenon in which two or more patent claims belonging to
different patent applications are proven to be overlapping by patent examiners.
Therefore, we use these interferences cases as a proxy for maximum similarity
between two patents, treating them as ground-truth to evaluate the performance
of the different embedding models. Our results point out that, first, Patent
SBERT-adapt-ub, the domain adaptation of the pretrained Sentence Transformer
architecture proposed in this research, outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in patent similarity. Second, they show that, in some cases,
large static models performances are still comparable to contextual ones when
trained on extensive data; thus, we believe that the superiority in the
performance of contextual embeddings may not be related to the actual
architecture but rather to the way the training phase is performed.

texts enhance our comprehension of crisis discourse, aiding decision-making and
targeted interventions. Pre-trained language models have advanced performance
in crisis informatics, but their contextual embeddings lack semantic
meaningfulness. Although the CrisisTransformers family includes a sentence
encoder to address the semanticity issue, it remains monolingual, processing
only English texts. Furthermore, employing separate models for different
languages leads to embeddings in distinct vector spaces, introducing challenges
when comparing semantic similarities between multi-lingual texts. Therefore, we
propose multi-lingual sentence encoders (CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE) that embed
crisis-related social media texts for over 50 languages, such that texts with
similar meanings are in close proximity within the same vector space,
irrespective of language diversity. Results in sentence encoding and sentence
matching tasks are promising, suggesting these models could serve as robust
baselines when embedding multi-lingual crisis-related social media texts. The
models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/crisistransformers.

parties are on the same page about the information being shared. This process,
known as conversational grounding, is crucial for building trustworthy dialog
systems that can accurately keep track of and recall the shared information.
The proficiencies of an agent in grounding the conveyed information
significantly contribute to building a reliable dialog system. Despite recent
advancements in dialog systems, there exists a noticeable deficit in their
grounding capabilities. Traum provided a framework for conversational grounding
introducing Grounding Acts and Grounding Units, but substantial progress,
especially in the realm of Large Language Models, remains lacking. To bridge
this gap, we present the annotation of two dialog corpora employing Grounding
Acts, Grounding Units, and a measure of their degree of grounding. We discuss
our key findings during the annotation and also provide a baseline model to
test the performance of current Language Models in categorizing the grounding
acts of the dialogs. Our work aims to provide a useful resource for further
research in making conversations with machines better understood and more
reliable in natural day-to-day collaborative dialogs.

fluent content across a wide spectrum of user queries. However, this capability
has raised concerns regarding misinformation and personal information leakage.
In this paper, we present our methods for the SemEval2024 Task8, aiming to
detect machine-generated text across various domains in both mono-lingual and
multi-lingual contexts. Our study comprehensively analyzes various methods to
detect machine-generated text, including statistical, neural, and pre-trained
model approaches. We also detail our experimental setup and perform a in-depth
error analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Our methods
obtain an accuracy of 86.9\% on the test set of subtask-A mono and 83.7\% for
subtask-B. Furthermore, we also highlight the challenges and essential factors
for consideration in future studies.

                                        <span>  We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to distill text:
to remove the textual traces of an undesired forbidden variable. We employ a
range of LLMs with varying architectures and training approaches to distill
text by identifying and removing information about the target variable while
preserving other relevant signals. Our findings shed light on the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in addressing the distillation and provide insights into
the strategies for leveraging these models in computational social science
investigations involving text data. In particular, we show that in the strong
test of removing sentiment, the statistical association between the processed
text and sentiment is still clearly detectable to machine learning classifiers
post-LLM-distillation. Furthermore, we find that human annotators also struggle
to distill sentiment while preserving other semantic content. This suggests
there may be limited separability between concept variables in some text
contexts, highlighting limitations of methods relying on text-level
transformations and also raising questions about the robustness of distillation
methods that achieve statistical independence in representation space if this
is difficult for human coders operating on raw text to attain.

language processing (NLP), but their effectiveness is largely dependent on
pre-training resources. This is especially evident in low-resource languages,
such as Sinhala, which face two primary challenges: the lack of substantial
training data and limited benchmarking datasets. In response, this study
introduces NSINA, a comprehensive news corpus of over 500,000 articles from
popular Sinhala news websites, along with three NLP tasks: news media
identification, news category prediction, and news headline generation. The
release of NSINA aims to provide a solution to challenges in adapting LLMs to
Sinhala, offering valuable resources and benchmarks for improving NLP in the

                                        <span>  The black-box nature of deep learning models in NLP hinders their widespread
application. The research focus has shifted to Hierarchical Attribution (HA)
for its ability to model feature interactions. Recent works model
non-contiguous combinations with a time-costly greedy search in Eculidean
spaces, neglecting underlying linguistic information in feature
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel method, namely Poincar\'e
Explanation (PE), for modeling feature interactions using hyperbolic spaces in
an $O(n^2logn)$ time complexity. Inspired by Poincar\'e model, we propose a
framework to project the embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, which exhibit
better inductive biases for syntax and semantic hierarchical structures.
Eventually, we prove that the hierarchical clustering process in the projected
space could be viewed as building a minimum spanning tree and propose a time
efficient algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

instances poses a significant challenge in few-shot relation classification.
Representations of textual data extract rich information spanning the domain,
entities, and relations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to
enhance information extraction combining multiple sentence representations and
contrastive learning. While representations in relation classification are
commonly extracted using entity marker tokens, we argue that substantial
information within the internal model representations remains untapped. To
address this, we propose aligning multiple sentence representations, such as
the [CLS] token, the [MASK] token used in prompting, and entity marker tokens.
Our method employs contrastive learning to extract complementary discriminative
information from these individual representations. This is particularly
relevant in low-resource settings where information is scarce. Leveraging
multiple sentence representations is especially effective in distilling
discriminative information for relation classification when additional
information, like relation descriptions, are not available. We validate the
adaptability of our approach, maintaining robust performance in scenarios that
include relation descriptions, and showcasing its flexibility to adapt to
different resource constraints.

agricultural field robots, and from health care assistants to the entertainment
industry. The majority of these systems are developed with modular
sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be
hand-engineered or learning-based. While these existing approaches have been
shown to perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for,
they can perform especially poorly in rare, out-of-distribution scenarios that
will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on
multiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has
led researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning
that existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense
reasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to
out-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large
language models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems
domains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in
deployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically,
foundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may
sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back
and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's
decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the
current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a
general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing
approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision
problems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.

visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain
abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,
locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided
generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the
model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to
generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the
limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme,
facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can
function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document
images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU
tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance
over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information
extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

                                        <span>  In-context learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to perform
diverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context
information, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between
high-resource and low-resource languages. Nonetheless, there is only a handful
of works explored ICL for low-resource languages with most of them focusing on
relatively high-resource languages, such as French and Spanish. In this work,
we extensively study ICL and its cross-lingual variation (X-ICL) on 25
low-resource and 7 relatively higher-resource languages. Our study not only
assesses the effectiveness of ICL with LLMs in low-resource languages but also
identifies the shortcomings of in-context label alignment, and introduces a
more effective alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we provide valuable
insights into various facets of ICL for low-resource languages. Our study
concludes the significance of few-shot in-context information on enhancing the
low-resource understanding quality of LLMs through semantically relevant
information by closing the language gap in the target language and aligning the
semantics between the targeted low-resource and the high-resource language that
the model is proficient in. Our work highlights the importance of advancing ICL
research, particularly for low-resource languages.

researchers have employed in-context learning for text classification tasks.
However, these studies focused on monolingual, single-turn classification
tasks. In this paper, we introduce LARA (Linguistic-Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models), designed to enhance accuracy in
multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating numerous
intents in chatbot interactions. Multi-turn intent classification is notably
challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational
contexts. LARA tackles these issues by combining a fine-tuned smaller model
with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of
LLMs. This integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and
relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context.
Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual
capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tune. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67%
compared to existing methods.

of location expressions in texts. Geoparsing must deal with the ambiguity of
the expressions that indicate multiple locations with the same notation. For
evaluating geoparsing systems, several corpora have been proposed in previous
work. However, these corpora are small-scale and suffer from the coverage of
location expressions on general domains. In this paper, we propose Wikipedia
Hyperlink-based Location Linking (WHLL), a novel method to construct a
large-scale corpus for geoparsing from Wikipedia articles. WHLL leverages
hyperlinks in Wikipedia to annotate multiple location expressions with
coordinates. With this method, we constructed the WHLL corpus, a new
large-scale corpus for geoparsing. The WHLL corpus consists of 1.3M articles,
each containing about 7.8 unique location expressions. 45.6% of location
expressions are ambiguous and refer to more than one location with the same
notation. In each article, location expressions of the article title and those
hyperlinks to other articles are assigned with coordinates. By utilizing
hyperlinks, we can accurately assign location expressions with coordinates even
with ambiguous location expressions in the texts. Experimental results show
that there remains room for improvement by disambiguating location expressions.

number of illustrative instances. Unfortunately, few-shot NER is severely
challenged by the intrinsic precise generalization problem, i.e., it is hard to
accurately determine the desired target type due to the ambiguity stemming from
information deficiency. In this paper, we propose Superposition Concept
Discriminator (SuperCD), which resolves the above challenge via an active
learning paradigm. Specifically, a concept extractor is first introduced to
identify superposition concepts from illustrative instances, with each concept
corresponding to a possible generalization boundary. Then a superposition
instance retriever is applied to retrieve corresponding instances of these
superposition concepts from large-scale text corpus. Finally, annotators are
asked to annotate the retrieved instances and these annotated instances
together with original illustrative instances are used to learn FS-NER models.
To this end, we learn a universal concept extractor and superposition instance
retriever using a large-scale openly available knowledge bases. Experiments
show that SuperCD can effectively identify superposition concepts from
illustrative instances, retrieve superposition instances from large-scale
corpus, and significantly improve the few-shot NER performance with minimal
additional efforts.

model significantly vary based on lexical categories during the fine-tuning
process for downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from the notion that in human
language processing, syntactic and semantic information is parsed differently,
we categorize tokens in sentences according to their lexical categories and
focus on changes in attention scores among these categories. Our hypothesis
posits that in downstream tasks that prioritize semantic information, attention
scores centered on content words are enhanced, while in cases emphasizing
syntactic information, attention scores centered on function words are
intensified. Through experimentation conducted on six tasks from the GLUE
benchmark dataset, we substantiate our hypothesis regarding the fine-tuning
process. Furthermore, our additional investigations reveal the presence of BERT
layers that consistently assign more bias to specific lexical categories,
irrespective of the task, highlighting the existence of task-agnostic lexical
category preferences.

clinical efficiency for medical diagnosis, owing to their unprecedented
performance in modelling natural language. Ensuring the safe and reliable
clinical applications, the evaluation of LLMs indeed becomes critical for
better mitigating the potential risks, e.g., hallucinations. However, current
evaluation methods heavily rely on labor-intensive human participation to

automatic evaluation paradigm tailored to assess the LLMs' capabilities in
delivering clinical services, e.g., disease diagnosis and treatment. The
evaluation paradigm contains three basic elements: metric, data, and algorithm.
Specifically, inspired by professional clinical practice pathways, we formulate
a LLM-specific clinical pathway (LCP) to define the clinical capabilities that
a doctor agent should possess. Then, Standardized Patients (SPs) from the
medical education are introduced as the guideline for collecting medical data
for evaluation, which can well ensure the completeness of the evaluation
procedure. Leveraging these steps, we develop a multi-agent framework to
simulate the interactive environment between SPs and a doctor agent, which is
equipped with a Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation (RAE) to determine whether the
behaviors of a doctor agent are in accordance with LCP. The above paradigm can
be extended to any similar clinical scenarios to automatically evaluate the
LLMs' medical capabilities. Applying such paradigm, we construct an evaluation
benchmark in the field of urology, including a LCP, a SPs dataset, and an
automated RAE. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing more insights for LLMs' safe
and reliable deployments in clinical practice.

to function well and achieve high performance in specific tasks. Accordingly,
in mainstream languages such as English, instruction-based datasets are being
constructed and made publicly available. In the case of Korean, publicly
available models and datasets all rely on using the output of ChatGPT or
translating datasets built in English. In this paper, We introduce
\textit{KIT-19} as an instruction dataset for the development of LLM in Korean.
\textit{KIT-19} is a dataset created in an instruction format, comprising 19
existing open-source datasets for Korean NLP tasks. In this paper, we train a
Korean Pretrained LLM using \textit{KIT-19} to demonstrate its effectiveness.
The experimental results show that the model trained on \textit{KIT-19}
significantly outperforms existing Korean LLMs. Based on the its quality and
empirical results, this paper proposes that \textit{KIT-19} has the potential
to make a substantial contribution to the future improvement of Korean LLMs'
performance.

tasks has shown the potential of fully automated software development. In light
of this, we introduce a new software engineering task, namely Natural Language
to code Repository (NL2Repo). This task aims to generate an entire code
repository from its natural language requirements. To address this task, we
propose a simple yet effective framework CodeS, which decomposes NL2Repo into
multiple sub-tasks by a multi-layer sketch. Specifically, CodeS includes three
modules: RepoSketcher, FileSketcher, and SketchFiller. RepoSketcher first
generates a repository's directory structure for given requirements;
FileSketcher then generates a file sketch for each file in the generated
structure; SketchFiller finally fills in the details for each function in the
generated file sketch. To rigorously assess CodeS on the NL2Repo task, we carry
out evaluations through both automated benchmarking and manual feedback
analysis. For benchmark-based evaluation, we craft a repository-oriented
benchmark, SketchEval, and design an evaluation metric, SketchBLEU. For
feedback-based evaluation, we develop a VSCode plugin for CodeS and engage 30
participants in conducting empirical studies. Extensive experiments prove the
effectiveness and practicality of CodeS on the NL2Repo task.

are based on visual attributes like shape. However, it is unclear to what
extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose
Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize important textual
features for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language
model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate the
important features for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify
the features that contribute to VLM representations. We find that spurious
descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no
helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly,
among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual
attributes like habitat to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis
reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their
representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene
descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly
influence their representations.

understanding and generation capabilities. To evaluate the capabilities of code
LLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval
and ClassEval). Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code
LLMs, but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient. Typically,
they focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the
evaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as
the logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if
the prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To
address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval,
for evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with
program execution. We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new
benchmarks within our framework. A large-scale empirical study is conducted and
most LLMs show unsatisfactory performance on both Runtime Behavior Reasoning
(i.e., an average accuracy of 44.4%) and Incremental Consistency Evaluation
(i.e., an average IC score of 10.3). Evaluation results of current code LLMs
reflect the urgent need for the community to strengthen the code reasoning
capability of code LLMs.

the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes
the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some
research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via
optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs
also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model,
raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent
studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated
to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of
corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based
learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable
tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with
adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and
develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs
by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the
target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger
tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of
$\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by
\textit{LinkPrompt} to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and
API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

                                        <span>  Definition bias is a negative phenomenon that can mislead models. Definition
bias in information extraction appears not only across datasets from different
domains but also within datasets sharing the same domain. We identify two types
of definition bias in IE: bias among information extraction datasets and bias
between information extraction datasets and instruction tuning datasets. To
systematically investigate definition bias, we conduct three probing
experiments to quantitatively analyze it and discover the limitations of
unified information extraction and large language models in solving definition
bias. To mitigate definition bias in information extraction, we propose a
multi-stage framework consisting of definition bias measurement, bias-aware
fine-tuning, and task-specific bias mitigation. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing definition bias.

                                        <span>  The literature on text-to-image generation is plagued by issues of faithfully
composing entities with relations. But there lacks a formal understanding of
how entity-relation compositions can be effectively learned. Moreover, the
underlying phenomenon space that meaningfully reflects the problem structure is
not well-defined, leading to an arms race for larger quantities of data in the
hope that generalization emerges out of large-scale pretraining. We hypothesize
that the underlying phenomenological coverage has not been proportionally
scaled up, leading to a skew of the presented phenomenon which harms
generalization. We introduce statistical metrics that quantify both the
linguistic and visual skew of a dataset for relational learning, and show that
generalization failures of text-to-image generation are a direct result of
incomplete or unbalanced phenomenological coverage. We first perform
experiments in a synthetic domain and demonstrate that systematically
controlled metrics are strongly predictive of generalization performance. Then
we move to natural images and show that simple distribution perturbations in
light of our theories boost generalization without enlarging the absolute data
size. This work informs an important direction towards quality-enhancing the
data diversity or balance orthogonal to scaling up the absolute size. Our
discussions point out important open questions on 1) Evaluation of generated
entity-relation compositions, and 2) Better models for reasoning with abstract
relations.

                                        <span>  Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning
about both visual elements and numerics. Although strong in extractive
questions, current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on
complex reasoning questions. In this work, we address the lack of reasoning
ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which
have shown to have strong reasoning ability, as an automatic data annotator
that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation
in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data
generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step
sub-questions (rationales), which are then used to derive the final answer
using external tools, i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is
trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation
pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed
step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA), we
significantly enhance the chart VQA models, achieving the state-of-the-art
accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular, our approach
improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54%
on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset, which needs strong
reasoning. We hope our work underscores the potential of synthetic data and
encourages further exploration of data augmentation using LLMs for
reasoning-heavy tasks.

                                        <span>  In information retrieval, facet identification of a user query is an
important task. If a search service can recognize the facets of a user's query,
it has the potential to offer users a much broader range of search results.
Previous studies can enhance facet prediction by leveraging retrieved documents
and related queries obtained through a search engine. However, there are
challenges in extending it to other applications when a search engine operates
as part of the model. First, search engines are constantly updated. Therefore,
additional information may change during training and test, which may reduce
performance. The second challenge is that public search engines cannot search
for internal documents. Therefore, a separate search system needs to be built
to incorporate documents from private domains within the company. We propose
two strategies that focus on a framework that can predict facets by taking only
queries as input without a search engine. The first strategy is multi-task
learning to predict SERP. By leveraging SERP as a target instead of a source,
the proposed model deeply understands queries without relying on external
modules. The second strategy is to enhance the facets by combining Large
Language Model (LLM) and the small model. Overall performance improves when
small model and LLM are combined rather than facet generation individually.

expressions (MWEs) on which sentiments are expressed and the sentiment
polarities associated with them. The development of supervised models has been
at the forefront of research in this area. However, training these models
requires the availability of manually annotated datasets which is both
expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the available annotated datasets are
tailored to a specific domain, language, and text type. In this work, we
address this notable challenge in current state-of-the-art ABSA research. We
propose a hybrid approach for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis using transfer
learning. The approach focuses on generating weakly-supervised annotations by
exploiting the strengths of both large language models (LLM) and traditional
syntactic dependencies. We utilise syntactic dependency structures of sentences
to complement the annotations generated by LLMs, as they may overlook
domain-specific aspect terms. Extensive experimentation on multiple datasets is
performed to demonstrate the efficacy of our hybrid method for the tasks of
aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification.

                                        <span>  Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an
initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL
do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents
in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do
not interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a
goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of
these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution
of plan steps, each using only single agent planning. By contrast, large
language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee
execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action
sequences. We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by
approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition. We
demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times
than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving
fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving
execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of
subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified
by human experts. Website and resources at https://glamor-usc.github.io/twostep

                                        <span>  Singleton mentions, i.e.~entities mentioned only once in a text, are
important to how humans understand discourse from a theoretical perspective.
However previous attempts to incorporate their detection in end-to-end neural
coreference resolution for English have been hampered by the lack of singleton
mention spans in the OntoNotes benchmark. This paper addresses this limitation
by combining predicted mentions from existing nested NER systems and features
derived from OntoNotes syntax trees. With this approach, we create a near
approximation of the OntoNotes dataset with all singleton mentions, achieving
~94% recall on a sample of gold singletons. We then propose a two-step neural
mention and coreference resolution system, named SPLICE, and compare its
performance to the end-to-end approach in two scenarios: the OntoNotes test set
and the out-of-domain (OOD) OntoGUM corpus. Results indicate that reconstructed
singleton training yields results comparable to end-to-end systems for
OntoNotes, while improving OOD stability (+1.1 avg. F1). We conduct error
analysis for mention detection and delve into its impact on coreference
clustering, revealing that precision improvements deliver more substantial
benefits than increases in recall for resolving coreference chains.

                                        <span>  For nearly three decades, language models derived from the $n$-gram
assumption held the state of the art on the task. The key to their success lay
in the application of various smoothing techniques that served to combat
overfitting. However, when neural language models toppled $n$-gram models as
the best performers, $n$-gram smoothing techniques became less relevant.
Indeed, it would hardly be an understatement to suggest that the line of
inquiry into $n$-gram smoothing techniques became dormant. This paper re-opens
the role classical $n$-gram smoothing techniques may play in the age of neural
language models. First, we draw a formal equivalence between label smoothing, a
popular regularization technique for neural language models, and add-$\lambda$
smoothing. Second, we derive a generalized framework for converting \emph{any}
$n$-gram smoothing technique into a regularizer compatible with neural language
models. Our empirical results find that our novel regularizers are comparable
to and, indeed, sometimes outperform label smoothing on language modeling and
machine translation.

                                        <span>  NLP models have been known to perform poorly on user-generated content (UGC),
mainly because it presents a lot of lexical variations and deviates from the
standard texts on which most of these models were trained. In this work, we
focus on the robustness of LASER, a sentence embedding model, to UGC data. We
evaluate this robustness by LASER's ability to represent non-standard sentences
and their standard counterparts close to each other in the embedding space.
Inspired by previous works extending LASER to other languages and modalities,
we propose RoLASER, a robust English encoder trained using a teacher-student
approach to reduce the distances between the representations of standard and
UGC sentences. We show that with training only on standard and synthetic
UGC-like data, RoLASER significantly improves LASER's robustness to both
natural and artificial UGC data by achieving up to 2x and 11x better scores. We
also perform a fine-grained analysis on artificial UGC data and find that our
model greatly outperforms LASER on its most challenging UGC phenomena such as
keyboard typos and social media abbreviations. Evaluation on downstream tasks
shows that RoLASER performs comparably to or better than LASER on standard
data, while consistently outperforming it on UGC data.

given ontology, as a generalisation of the well-studied taxonomy expansion
task. One line of work treats this task as a Natural Language Inference (NLI)
problem, thus relying on the knowledge captured by language models to identify
the missing knowledge. Another line of work uses concept embeddings to identify
what different concepts have in common, taking inspiration from cognitive
models for category based induction. These two approaches are intuitively
complementary, but their effectiveness has not yet been compared. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating ontology completion methods and
thoroughly analyse the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. We find
that both approaches are indeed complementary, with hybrid strategies achieving
the best overall results. We also find that the task is highly challenging for
Large Language Models, even after fine-tuning.

                                        <span>  Background: Social support (SS) and social isolation (SI) are social
determinants of health (SDOH) associated with psychiatric outcomes. In
electronic health records (EHRs), individual-level SS/SI is typically
documented as narrative clinical notes rather than structured coded data.
Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can automate the otherwise
labor-intensive process of data extraction.
  Data and Methods: Psychiatric encounter notes from Mount Sinai Health System
(MSHS, n=300) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM, n=225) were annotated and
established a gold standard corpus. A rule-based system (RBS) involving
lexicons and a large language model (LLM) using FLAN-T5-XL were developed to
identify mentions of SS and SI and their subcategories (e.g., social network,
instrumental support, and loneliness).
  Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macro-averaged
f-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 vs. 0.65) and WCM (0.85 vs. 0.82). For
extracting subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90
vs. 0.62) and WCM (0.82 vs. 0.81).
  Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across
all metrics. Intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the
divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM. The RBS were designed and refined
to follow the same specific rules as the gold standard annotations. Conversely,
the LLM were more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common
English-language understanding. Both approaches offer advantages and are made
available open-source for future testing.

                                        <span>  Automated fact checking has gained immense interest to tackle the growing
misinformation in the digital era. Existing systems primarily focus on
synthetic claims on Wikipedia, and noteworthy progress has also been made on
real-world claims. In this work, we release Numtemp, a diverse, multi-domain
dataset focused exclusively on numerical claims, encompassing temporal,
statistical and diverse aspects with fine-grained metadata and an evidence
collection without leakage. This addresses the challenge of verifying
real-world numerical claims, which are complex and often lack precise
information, not addressed by existing works that mainly focus on synthetic
claims. We evaluate and quantify the limitations of existing solutions for the
task of verifying numerical claims. We also evaluate claim decomposition based
methods, numerical understanding based models and our best baselines achieves a
macro-F1 of 58.32. This demonstrates that Numtemp serves as a challenging
evaluation set for numerical claim verification.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the concept of the male gaze (Mulvey, 1975) in literature and
media studies, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing gender bias in
terms of female objectification: the extent to which a text portrays female
individuals as objects of visual pleasure. Our framework measures female
objectification along two axes. First, we compute an agency bias score that
indicates whether male entities are more likely to appear in the text as
grammatical agents than female entities. Next, by analyzing the word embedding
space induced by a text (Caliskan et al., 2017), we compute an appearance bias
score that indicates whether female entities are more closely associated with
appearance-related words than male entities. Applying our framework to 19th and
20th century novels reveals evidence of female objectification in literature:
we find that novels written from a male perspective systematically objectify
female characters, while novels written from a female perspective do not
exhibit statistically significant objectification of any gender.

alternative to mitigate the negative impact of hate speech and foster
productive online communications. Research endeavors have been directed to
using language models for the automatic generation of counterspeech to assist
efforts in combating online hate. Existing research focuses on the generation
of counterspeech with certain linguistic attributes, such as being polite,
informative, and intent-driven. However, it remains unclear what impact the
counterspeech might have in an online environment. We first explore methods
that utilize large language models (LLM) to generate counterspeech constrained
by potential conversation outcomes. We build two conversation outcome
classifiers that predict the incivility level and the hater reentry behavior
following replies to hate with Reddit data, then propose four methods to
incorporate the desired outcomes, i.e., low conversation incivility and
non-hateful hater reentry, into the text generation process, including Prompt
with Instructions, Prompt and Select, LLM finetune, and LLM transformer
reinforcement learning (TRL). Evaluation results show effective strategies to
generate outcome-constrained counterspeech and the linguistic characteristics
of texts generated by different methods.

biographical information in the context of digital humanities and related
subjects. There is a growing interest in the community to build datasets
capable of training machine learning models to extract relationships. However,
annotating such datasets can be expensive and time-consuming, in addition to
being limited to English. This paper applies guided distant supervision to
create a large biographical relationship extraction dataset for German. Our
dataset, composed of more than 80,000 instances for nine relationship types, is
the largest biographical German relationship extraction dataset. We also create
a manually annotated dataset with 2000 instances to evaluate the models and
release it together with the dataset compiled using guided distant supervision.
We train several state-of-the-art machine learning models on the automatically
created dataset and release them as well. Furthermore, we experiment with
multilingual and cross-lingual experiments that could benefit many low-resource
languages.

heterogeneous human expectations and values via multi-objective preference
alignment. However, existing methods are parameter-adherent to the policy
model, leading to two key limitations: (1) the high-cost repetition of their
alignment algorithms for each new target model; (2) they cannot expand to
unseen objectives due to their static alignment objectives. In this work, we
propose Meta-Objective Aligner (MetaAligner), a model that performs conditional
weak-to-strong correction for weak responses to approach strong responses.
MetaAligner is the first policy-agnostic and generalizable method for
multi-objective preference alignment, which enables plug-and-play alignment by
decoupling parameter updates from the policy models and facilitates zero-shot
preference alignment for unseen objectives via in-context learning.
Experimental results show that MetaAligner achieves significant and balanced
improvements in multi-objective alignments on 11 policy models with up to 63x
more parameters, and outperforms previous alignment methods with down to 22.27x
less computational resources. The model also accurately aligns with unseen
objectives, marking the first step towards generalizable multi-objective
preference alignment.

(2) phase 1 and 2 cancer trials, (3) heart disease trials, (4) type 2 diabetes
trials, and (5) observational trials for any disease, comprising 2,490
annotated eligibility criteria across seven exclusion types. Our results show
that models trained on the extensive cancer dataset can effectively handle
criteria commonly found in non-cancer trials, such as autoimmune diseases.
However, they struggle with criteria disproportionately prevalent in cancer
trials, like prior malignancy. We also experiment with few-shot learning,
demonstrating that a limited number of disease-specific examples can partially
overcome this performance gap. We are releasing this new dataset of annotated
eligibility statements to promote the development of cross-disease
generalization in clinical trial classification.

                                        <span>  In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for performing
natural language tasks with Large Language Models (LLM) without updating the
models' parameters, in contrast to the traditional gradient-based finetuning.
The promise of ICL is that the LLM can adapt to perform the present task at a
competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the cost. The ability of
LLMs to perform tasks in this few-shot manner relies on their background
knowledge of the task (or task priors). However, recent work has found that,
unlike traditional learning, LLMs are unable to fully integrate information
from demonstrations that contrast task priors. This can lead to performance
saturation at suboptimal levels, especially for subjective tasks such as
emotion recognition, where the mapping from text to emotions can differ widely
due to variability in human annotations. In this work, we design experiments
and propose measurements to explicitly quantify the consistency of proxies of
LLM priors and their pull on the posteriors. We show that LLMs have strong yet
inconsistent priors in emotion recognition that ossify their predictions. We
also find that the larger the model, the stronger these effects become. Our
results suggest that caution is needed when using ICL with larger LLMs for
affect-centered tasks outside their pre-training domain and when interpreting
ICL results.

                                        <span>  Grounding the common-sense reasoning of Large Language Models in physical
domains remains a pivotal yet unsolved problem for embodied AI. Whereas prior
works have focused on leveraging LLMs directly for planning in symbolic spaces,
this work uses LLMs to guide the search of task structures and constraints
implicit in multi-step demonstrations. Specifically, we borrow from
manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group
robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction
layer between the high-level language representations of an LLM and the
low-level physical trajectories of a robot. By replaying a few human
demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the
demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as
counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework
trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful
trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground
low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The
learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans
into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We
show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation
learning through 2D navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks.

                                        <span>  Recent efforts to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have
focused on attributed text generation, which supplements generated texts with
citations of supporting sources for post-generation fact-checking and
corrections. Yet, these citations often point to entire documents or
paragraphs, burdening users with extensive verification work. In this paper, we
introduce a locally-attributable text generation approach, prioritizing concise
attributions. Our method, named ``Attribute First, then Generate'', breaks down
the conventional end-to-end generation process into three intuitive steps:
content selection, sentence planning, and sequential sentence generation. By
initially identifying relevant source segments (``select first'') and then
conditioning the generation process on them (``then generate''), we ensure
these segments also act as the output's fine-grained attributions (``select''
becomes ``attribute''). Tested on Multi-document Summarization and Long-form
Question-answering, our method not only yields more concise citations than the
baselines but also maintains - and in some cases enhances - both generation
quality and attribution accuracy. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
time required for fact verification by human assessors.

high-resource settings, many languages lack the necessary large parallel
corpora to benefit from it. In the context of low-resource (LR) MT between two
closely-related languages, a natural intuition is to seek benefits from
structural "shortcuts", such as copying subwords from the source to the target,
given that such language pairs often share a considerable number of identical
words, cognates, and borrowings. We test Pointer-Generator Networks for this
purpose for six language pairs over a variety of resource ranges, and find weak
improvements for most settings. However, analysis shows that the model does not
show greater improvements for closely-related vs. more distant language pairs,
or for lower resource ranges, and that the models do not exhibit the expected
usage of the mechanism for shared subwords. Our discussion of the reasons for
this behaviour highlights several general challenges for LR NMT, such as modern
tokenization strategies, noisy real-world conditions, and linguistic
complexities. We call for better scrutiny of linguistically motivated
improvements to NMT given the blackbox nature of Transformer models, as well as
for a focus on the above problems in the field.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous
domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and
efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic
computational demands. Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the
attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods
introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring
additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a
training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking
multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to
attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer
sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to
process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context
chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the
inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently
distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures
it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while
different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.
LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that
use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k
length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending
the usable context window for existing models. We release our code at

                                        <span>  Prompt Tuning is a popular parameter-efficient finetuning method for
pre-trained large language models (PLMs). Based on experiments with RoBERTa, it
has been suggested that Prompt Tuning activates specific neurons in the
transformer's feed-forward networks, that are highly predictive and selective
for the given task. In this paper, we study the robustness of Prompt Tuning in
relation to these "skill neurons", using RoBERTa and T5. We show that prompts
tuned for a specific task are transferable to tasks of the same type but are
not very robust to adversarial data. While prompts tuned for RoBERTa yield
below-chance performance on adversarial data, prompts tuned for T5 are slightly
more robust and retain above-chance performance in two out of three cases. At
the same time, we replicate the finding that skill neurons exist in RoBERTa and
further show that skill neurons also exist in T5. Interestingly, the skill
neurons of T5 determined on non-adversarial data are also among the most
predictive neurons on the adversarial data, which is not the case for RoBERTa.
We conclude that higher adversarial robustness may be related to a model's
ability to consistently activate the relevant skill neurons on adversarial
data.

                                        <span>  During task-oriented dialogues (TODs), human users naturally introduce
chitchat that is beyond the immediate scope of the task, interfering with the
flow of the conversation. To address this issue without the need for expensive
manual data creation, we use few-shot prompting with Llama-2-70B to enhance the
MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat
interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two
models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a
preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis demonstrates that our enhanced
dataset poses a challenge for these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to
consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving
the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation. These
findings highlight the benefits of generating novel chitchat-TOD scenarios to
test TOD systems more thoroughly and improve their resilience to natural user
interferences

                                        <span>  Generative language models are usually pretrained on large text corpus via
predicting the next token (i.e., sub-word/word/phrase) given the previous ones.
Recent works have demonstrated the impressive performance of large generative
language models on downstream tasks. However, existing generative language
models generally neglect an inherent challenge in text corpus during training,
i.e., the imbalance between frequent tokens and infrequent ones. It can lead a
language model to be dominated by common and easy-to-learn tokens, thereby
overlooking the infrequent and difficult-to-learn ones. To alleviate that, we
propose a MiLe Loss function for mitigating the bias of learning difficulties
with tokens. During training, it can dynamically assess the learning difficulty
of a to-be-learned token, according to the information entropy of the
corresponding predicted probability distribution over the vocabulary. Then it
scales the training loss adaptively, trying to lead the model to focus more on
the difficult-to-learn tokens. On the Pile dataset, we train generative
language models at different scales of 468M, 1.2B, and 6.7B parameters.
Experiments reveal that models incorporating the proposed MiLe Loss can gain
consistent performance improvement on downstream benchmarks.

                                        <span>  The advent of scalable deep models and large datasets has improved the
performance of Neural Machine Translation. Knowledge Distillation (KD) enhances
efficiency by transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a more compact
student model. However, KD approaches to Transformer architecture often rely on
heuristics, particularly when deciding which teacher layers to distill from. In
this paper, we introduce the 'Align-to-Distill' (A2D) strategy, designed to
address the feature mapping problem by adaptively aligning student attention
heads with their teacher counterparts during training. The Attention Alignment
Module in A2D performs a dense head-by-head comparison between student and
teacher attention heads across layers, turning the combinatorial mapping
heuristics into a learning problem. Our experiments show the efficacy of A2D,
demonstrating gains of up to +3.61 and +0.63 BLEU points for WMT-2022 De->Dsb
and WMT-2014 En->De, respectively, compared to Transformer baselines.

go-to framework for privacy-preserving model training or data sharing, the
choice and interpretation of the key parameter, privacy budget $\varepsilon$
that governs the strength of privacy protection, remains largely arbitrary. We
argue that determining the $\varepsilon$ value should not be solely in the
hands of researchers or system developers, but must also take into account the
actual people who share their potentially sensitive data. In other words: Would
you share your instant messages for $\varepsilon$ of 10? We address this
research gap by designing, implementing, and conducting a behavioral experiment
(311 lay participants) to study the behavior of people in uncertain
decision-making situations with respect to privacy-threatening situations.
Framing the risk perception in terms of two realistic NLP scenarios and using a
vignette behavioral study help us determine what $\varepsilon$ thresholds would
lead lay people to be willing to share sensitive textual data - to our
knowledge, the first study of its kind.

content is increasingly challenging. Fact-checking has emerged as an approach
to assess the veracity of factual claims using evidence from credible knowledge
sources. To help advance automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions
for this task, in this paper we introduce a novel dataset HealthFC. It consists
of 750 health-related claims in German and English, labeled for veracity by
medical experts and backed with evidence from systematic reviews and clinical
trials. We provide an analysis of the dataset, highlighting its characteristics
and challenges. The dataset can be used for NLP tasks related to automated
fact-checking, such as evidence retrieval, claim verification, or explanation
generation. For testing purposes, we provide baseline systems based on
different approaches, examine their performance, and discuss the findings. We
show that the dataset is a challenging test bed with a high potential for
future use.

                                        <span>  Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation
with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current
language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context
window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches
demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference
phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept.
Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds
this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long
text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated
previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge
but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that
the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19
language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation
benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1)
Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated
by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3%
decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of
GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text
generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by
shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate
improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a
51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.

several candidates based on a given user and system utterance history. Most
existing works primarily focus on post-training and fine-tuning tailored for
cross-encoders. However, there are no post-training methods tailored for dense
encoders in dialogue response selection. We argue that when the current
language model, based on dense dialogue systems (such as BERT), is employed as
a dense encoder, it separately encodes dialogue context and response, leading
to a struggle to achieve the alignment of both representations. Thus, we
propose Dial-MAE (Dialogue Contextual Masking Auto-Encoder), a straightforward
yet effective post-training technique tailored for dense encoders in dialogue
response selection. Dial-MAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to
compress the dialogue semantics into dense vectors, which achieves better
alignment between the features of the dialogue context and response. Our
experiments have demonstrated that Dial-MAE is highly effective, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on two commonly evaluated benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their enormous
parameter size and extremely high requirements for compute power pose
challenges for their practical deployment. Recent research has revealed that
specific capabilities of LLMs, such as numerical reasoning, can be transferred
to smaller models through distillation. Some studies explore the potential of
leveraging LLMs to perform table-based reasoning. However, there has been no
prior work focusing on table reasoning skills in smaller models specifically
tailored for scientific table-to-text generation tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel table-based reasoning distillation approach, with the aim of
distilling LLMs into tailored smaller models. Our experimental results have
shown that a 220 million parameter model (Flan-T5-base) fine-tuned using
distilled data, not only achieves a significant improvement compared to
traditionally fine-tuned baselines, but also surpasses specific LLMs on a
scientific table-to-text generation dataset. Our code is available at

designed to establish control groups. This structure enables us to conduct a
quantitative analysis of the models' response tendencies, logical consistency,

15 different models, highlighting a 31.42% question-pair accuracy achieved by
the state-of-the-art GPT-4V. Notably, all other evaluated models achieve
accuracy below 16%. Moreover, our analysis not only highlights the observed
failure modes, including language hallucination and visual illusion, but also
deepens an understanding of these pitfalls. Our comprehensive case studies

                                        <span>  Artificial intelligence has been around for a while, but suddenly it has
received more attention than ever before. Thanks to innovations from companies
like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other major brands in technology. OpenAI,
though, has triggered the button with its ground-breaking invention ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) based on Transformer architecture that
has the ability to generate human-like responses in a conversational context.
It uses deep learning algorithms to generate natural language responses to
input text. Its large number of parameters, contextual generation, and
open-domain training make it a versatile and effective tool for a wide range of
applications, from chatbots to customer service to language translation. It has
the potential to revolutionize various industries and transform the way we
interact with technology. However, the use of ChatGPT has also raised several
concerns, including ethical, social, and employment challenges, which must be
carefully considered to ensure the responsible use of this technology. The
article provides an overview of ChatGPT, delving into its architecture and
training process. It highlights the potential impacts of ChatGPT on the
society. In this paper, we suggest some approaches involving technology,
regulation, education, and ethics in an effort to maximize ChatGPT's benefits
while minimizing its negative impacts. This study is expected to contribute to
a greater understanding of ChatGPT and aid in predicting the potential changes
it may bring about.

                                        <span>  The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on
tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential
elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long
seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention
operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying
or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot
straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often
require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and
linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention
matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention
with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with
linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates
a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention
operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse
attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the
quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than
OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable
attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,
as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited
devices with less memory.

to humans, and large pretrained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities to generate coherent natural language explanations (NLE).
The existing NLE research perspectives do not take the audience into account.
An NLE can have high textual quality, but it might not accommodate audiences'
needs and preference. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative
perspective, \textit{situated} NLE. On the evaluation side, we set up automated
evaluation scores. These scores describe the properties of NLEs in lexical,
semantic, and pragmatic categories. On the generation side, we identify three
prompt engineering techniques and assess their applicability on the situations.
Situated NLE provides a perspective and facilitates further research on the
generation and evaluation of explanations.

The robustness of such watermark-based detector against evasion attacks in the
white-box and black-box settings is well understood in the literature. However,
the robustness in the no-box setting is much less understood. In particular,
multiple studies claimed that image watermark is robust in such setting. In
this work, we propose a new transfer evasion attack to image watermark in the
no-box setting. Our transfer attack adds a perturbation to a watermarked image
to evade multiple surrogate watermarking models trained by the attacker itself,
and the perturbed watermarked image also evades the target watermarking model.
Our major contribution is to show that, both theoretically and empirically,
watermark-based AI-generated image detector is not robust to evasion attacks
even if the attacker does not have access to the watermarking model nor the
detection API.

                                        <span>  Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research focus in both academic
and industry communities. Previous research in this field often focuses on
training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which
diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents
hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast
amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an
upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review
of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More
specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents,
for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the
previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse
applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science,
natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation
strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous
studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this
field. To keep track of this field and continuously update our survey, we
maintain a repository of relevant references at

                                        <span>  Object navigation (ObjectNav) requires an agent to navigate through unseen
environments to find queried objects. Many previous methods attempted to solve
this task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are
trained on limited household datasets with close-set objects. However, two key
challenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions
that demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a
zero-shot manner. Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose
OpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object
Navigation. We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet
the user's demand. We then leverage the generalizability of large vision
language models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from
the scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM). Then, by conducting
common sense reasoning on VSSM, our method can perform effective
language-guided exploration and exploitation of the scene and finally reach the
goal. By leveraging the reasoning and generalizing abilities of foundation
models, our method can understand free-form human instructions and perform
effective open-set zero-shot navigation in diverse environments. Extensive
experiments on the HM3D ObjectNav benchmark show that our method surpasses all
the strong baselines on all metrics, proving our method's effectiveness.
Furthermore, we perform real robot demonstrations to validate our method's
open-set-ness and generalizability to real-world environments.

simulating human-like behavior, raising the question of their ability to
represent a diverse population of users. We introduce a new protocol to measure
the degree to which language models can accurately emulate human behavior in
conversational recommendation. This protocol is comprised of five tasks, each
designed to evaluate a key property that a synthetic user should exhibit:
choosing which items to talk about, expressing binary preferences, expressing
open-ended preferences, requesting recommendations, and giving feedback.
Through evaluation of baseline simulators, we demonstrate these tasks
effectively reveal deviations of language models from human behavior, and offer
insights on how to reduce the deviations with model selection and prompting

                                        <span>  The widespread presence of offensive languages on social media has resulted
in adverse effects on societal well-being. As a result, it has become very
important to address this issue with high priority. Offensive languages exist
in both explicit and implicit forms, with the latter being more challenging to
detect. Current research in this domain encounters several challenges. Firstly,
the existing datasets primarily rely on the collection of texts containing
explicit offensive keywords, making it challenging to capture implicitly
offensive contents that are devoid of these keywords. Secondly, usual
methodologies tend to focus solely on textual analysis, neglecting the valuable
insights that community information can provide. In this research paper, we
introduce a novel dataset OffLanDat, a community based implicit offensive
language dataset generated by ChatGPT containing data for 38 different target
groups. Despite limitations in generating offensive texts using ChatGPT due to
ethical constraints, we present a prompt-based approach that effectively
generates implicit offensive languages. To ensure data quality, we evaluate our
data with human. Additionally, we employ a prompt-based Zero-Shot method with
ChatGPT and compare the detection results between human annotation and ChatGPT
annotation. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models to see how effective
they are in detecting such languages. We will make our code and dataset public
for other researchers.

                                        <span>  End-to-end multi-task dialogue systems are usually designed with separate
modules for the dialogue pipeline. Among these, the policy module is essential
for deciding what to do in response to user input. This policy is trained by
reinforcement learning algorithms by taking advantage of an environment in
which an agent receives feedback in the form of a reward signal. The current
dialogue systems, however, only provide meagre and simplistic rewards.
Investigating intrinsic motivation reinforcement learning algorithms is the
goal of this study. Through this, the agent can quickly accelerate training and
improve its capacity to judge the quality of its actions by teaching it an
internal incentive system. In particular, we adapt techniques for random
network distillation and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to measure the
frequency of state visits and encourage exploration by using semantic
similarity between utterances. Experimental results on MultiWOZ, a
heterogeneous dataset, show that intrinsic motivation-based debate systems
outperform policies that depend on extrinsic incentives. By adopting random
network distillation, for example, which is trained using semantic similarity
between user-system dialogues, an astounding average success rate of 73% is
achieved. This is a significant improvement over the baseline Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which has an average success rate of 60%. In addition,
performance indicators such as booking rates and completion rates show a 10%
rise over the baseline. Furthermore, these intrinsic incentive models help
improve the system's policy's resilience in an increasing amount of domains.
This implies that they could be useful in scaling up to settings that cover a
wider range of domains.

                                        <span>  Recent research in decoding methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG)
tasks has shown that MAP decoding is not optimal, because model probabilities
do not always align with human preferences. Stronger decoding methods,
including Quality Estimation (QE) reranking and Minimum Bayes' Risk (MBR)
decoding, have since been proposed to mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality
mismatch. While these decoding methods achieve state-of-the-art performance,
they are prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we propose MBR
finetuning and QE finetuning which distill the quality gains from these
decoding methods at training time, while using an efficient decoding algorithm
at inference time. Using the canonical NLG task of Neural Machine Translation
(NMT), we show that even with self-training, these finetuning methods
significantly outperform the base model. Moreover, when using an external LLM
as a teacher model, these finetuning methods outperform finetuning on
human-generated references. These findings suggest new ways to leverage
monolingual data to achieve improvements in model quality that are on par with,
or even exceed, improvements from human-curated data, while maintaining maximum
efficiency during decoding.

inform the prediction of emotion detection models? This work investigates how
well human-annotated emotion triggers correlate with features that models
deemed salient in their prediction of emotions. First, we introduce a novel
dataset EmoTrigger, consisting of 900 social media posts sourced from three
different datasets; these were annotated by experts for emotion triggers with
high agreement. Using EmoTrigger, we evaluate the ability of large language
models (LLMs) to identify emotion triggers, and conduct a comparative analysis
of the features considered important for these tasks between LLMs and
fine-tuned models. Our analysis reveals that emotion triggers are largely not
considered salient features for emotion prediction models, instead there is
intricate interplay between various features and the task of emotion detection.

developer productivity for high-resource programming languages. These models
use two kinds of data: large amounts of unlabeled code samples for pre-training
and relatively smaller amounts of labeled code samples for fine-tuning or
in-context learning. Unfortunately, many programming languages are
low-resource, lacking labeled samples for most tasks and often even lacking
unlabeled samples. Therefore, users of low-resource languages (e.g., legacy or
new languages) miss out on the benefits of LLMs. Cross-lingual transfer uses
data from a source language to improve model performance on a target language.
It has been well-studied for natural languages, but has received little
attention for programming languages. This paper reports extensive experiments
on four tasks using a transformer-based LLM and 11 to 41 programming languages
to explore the following questions. First, how well does cross-lingual transfer
work for a given task across different language pairs. Second, given a task and
target language, how should one choose a source language. Third, which
characteristics of a language pair are predictive of transfer performance, and
how does that depend on the given task. Our empirical study with 1,808
experiments reveals practical and scientific insights, such as Kotlin and
JavaScript being the most transferable source languages and different tasks
relying on substantially different features. Overall, we find that learning
transfers well across several programming languages.

Query Language (SQL), is crucial for enabling broad access to structured
databases without expert knowledge. However, designing models for such tasks is
challenging due to numerous factors, including the presence of 'noise,' such as
ambiguous questions and syntactical errors. This study provides an in-depth
analysis of the distribution and types of noise in the widely used BIRD-Bench
benchmark and the impact of noise on models. While BIRD-Bench was created to
model dirty and noisy database values, it was not created to contain noise and
errors in the questions and gold queries. We found that noise in questions and
gold queries are prevalent in the dataset, with varying amounts across domains,
and with an uneven distribution between noise types. The presence of incorrect
gold SQL queries, which then generate incorrect gold answers, has a significant
impact on the benchmark's reliability. Surprisingly, when evaluating models on
corrected SQL queries, zero-shot baselines surpassed the performance of
state-of-the-art prompting methods. We conclude that informative noise labels
and reliable benchmarks are crucial to developing new Text-to-SQL methods that
can handle varying types of noise. All datasets, annotations, and code are

                                        <span>  Identifying implicit attitudes toward food can mitigate social prejudice due
to food's salience as a marker of ethnic identity. Stereotypes about food are
representational harms that may contribute to racialized discourse and
negatively impact economic outcomes for restaurants. Understanding the presence
of representational harms in online corpora in particular is important, given
the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation and
their tendency to reproduce attitudes in their training data. Through careful
linguistic analyses, we evaluate social theories about attitudes toward
immigrant cuisine in a large-scale study of framing differences in 2.1M English
language Yelp reviews. Controlling for factors such as restaurant price and
neighborhood racial diversity, we find that immigrant cuisines are more likely
to be othered using socially constructed frames of authenticity (e.g.,
"authentic," "traditional"), and that non-European cuisines (e.g., Indian,
Mexican) in particular are described as more exotic compared to European ones
(e.g., French). We also find that non-European cuisines are more likely to be
described as cheap and dirty, even after controlling for price, and even among
the most expensive restaurants. Finally, we show that reviews generated by LLMs
reproduce similar framing tendencies, pointing to the downstream retention of
these representational harms. Our results corroborate social theories of
gastronomic stereotyping, revealing racialized evaluative processes and
linguistic strategies through which they manifest.

variety of vision tasks. However, the generation of such knowledge entails
considerable human labor and time costs. This study investigates the potential
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating and providing domain-specific
information through semantic embeddings. To achieve this, an LLM is integrated
into a pipeline that utilizes Knowledge Graphs and pre-trained semantic vectors
in the context of the Vision-based Zero-shot Object State Classification task.
We thoroughly examine the behavior of the LLM through an extensive ablation
study. Our findings reveal that the integration of LLM-based embeddings, in
combination with general-purpose pre-trained embeddings, leads to substantial
performance improvements. Drawing insights from this ablation study, we conduct
a comparative analysis against competing models, thereby highlighting the
state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed approach.

sentence production and comprehension, and their internal representations are
remarkably well-aligned with representations of language in the human brain.
But to achieve these results, LMs must be trained in distinctly un-human-like
ways - requiring orders of magnitude more language data than children receive
during development, and without perceptual or social context. Do models trained
more naturalistically -- with grounded supervision -- exhibit more humanlike
language learning? We investigate this question in the context of word
learning, a key sub-task in language acquisition. We train a diverse set of LM
architectures, with and without auxiliary visual supervision, on datasets of
varying scales. We then evaluate these models' learning of syntactic
categories, lexical relations, semantic features, word similarity, and
alignment with human neural representations. We find that visual supervision
can indeed improve the efficiency of word learning. However, these improvements
are limited: they are present almost exclusively in the low-data regime, and
sometimes canceled out by the inclusion of rich distributional signals from
text. The information conveyed by text and images is not redundant -- models
mainly driven by visual information yield qualitatively different from those
mainly driven by word co-occurrences. However, our results suggest that current
multimodal modeling approaches fail to effectively leverage visual information
to build human-like word representations from human-scale data.

their remarkable success in tasks that required estimating and sampling data
distribution to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. In speech,
text-to-speech synthesis and neural vocoder are good examples where generative
models have shined. While generative models have been applied to different
applications in speech, there exists no general-purpose generative model that
models speech directly. In this work, we take a step toward this direction by
showing a single pre-trained generative model can be adapted to different
downstream tasks with strong performance. Specifically, we pre-trained a
generative model, named SpeechFlow, on 60k hours of untranscribed speech with
Flow Matching and masked conditions. Experiment results show the pre-trained
generative model can be fine-tuned with task-specific data to match or surpass
existing expert models on speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. Our
work suggested a foundational model for generation tasks in speech can be built
with generative pre-training.

treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide
a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research
articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how
LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI
areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record
management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review
identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major
developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical
concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy
and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could
further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and
patient outcomes. This comprehensive review serves as a resource for
stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and
policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in
BHI.

and their definitions is increasing as well. As per the Joint Practical Guide
of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, terms used in legal
documents shall be consistent, and identical concepts shall be expressed
without departing from their meaning in ordinary, legal, or technical language.
Thus, while drafting a new legislative document, having a framework that
provides insights about existing definitions and helps define new terms based
on a document's context will support such harmonized legal definitions across
different regulations and thus avoid ambiguities. In this paper, we present
LexDrafter, a framework that assists in drafting Definitions articles for
legislative documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and existing
term definitions present in different legislative documents. For this,
definition elements are built by extracting definitions from existing
documents. Using definition elements and RAG, a Definitions article can be
suggested on demand for a legislative document that is being drafted. We

                                        <span>  We study the patent phrase similarity inference task, which measures the
semantic similarity between two patent phrases. As patent documents employ
legal and highly technical language, existing semantic textual similarity
methods that use localized contextual information do not perform satisfactorily
in inferring patent phrase similarity. To address this, we introduce a
graph-augmented approach to amplify the global contextual information of the
patent phrases. For each patent phrase, we construct a phrase graph that links
to its focal patents and a list of patents that are either cited by or cite
these focal patents. The augmented phrase embedding is then derived from
combining its localized contextual embedding with its global embedding within
the phrase graph. We further propose a self-supervised learning objective that
capitalizes on the retrieved topology to refine both the contextualized
embedding and the graph parameters in an end-to-end manner. Experimental
results from a unique patent phrase similarity dataset demonstrate that our
approach significantly enhances the representation of patent phrases, resulting
in marked improvements in similarity inference in a self-supervised fashion.
Substantial improvements are also observed in the supervised setting,
underscoring the potential benefits of leveraging retrieved phrase graph
augmentation.

extensive use in automatically detecting significant topics within a corpus of
documents. However, classic topic modelling approaches (e.g., LDA) have certain
drawbacks, such as the lack of semantic understanding and the presence of
overlapping topics. In this work, we investigate the untapped potential of
large language models (LLMs) as an alternative for uncovering the underlying
topics within extensive text corpora. To this end, we introduce a framework
that prompts LLMs to generate topics from a given set of documents and
establish evaluation protocols to assess the clustering efficacy of LLMs. Our
findings indicate that LLMs with appropriate prompts can stand out as a viable
alternative, capable of generating relevant topic titles and adhering to human
guidelines to refine and merge topics. Through in-depth experiments and
evaluation, we summarise the advantages and constraints of employing LLMs in
topic extraction.

attention span is a contingency, and people who spend time reading lengthy news
articles are decreasing rapidly and the need for succinct information is higher
than ever before. Therefore, it is essential to provide a quick overview of
important news by concisely summarizing the top news article and the most
intuitive headline. When humans try to make summaries, they extract the
essential information from the source and add useful phrases and grammatical
annotations from the original extract. Humans have a unique ability to create
abstractions. However, automatic summarization is a complicated problem to
solve. The use of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for neural abstractive
text summarization has been ascending as far as prevalence. Numerous innovative
strategies have been proposed to develop the current seq2seq models further,
permitting them to handle different issues like saliency, familiarity, and
human lucidness and create excellent synopses. In this article, we aimed toward
enhancing the present architectures and models for abstractive text
summarization. The modifications have been aimed at fine-tuning
hyper-parameters, attempting specific encoder-decoder combinations. We examined
many experiments on an extensively used CNN/DailyMail dataset to check the
effectiveness of various models.

examples in in-context learning models. However, assessing structural
similarity based solely on the natural language expressions of queries, without
considering SQL queries, presents a significant challenge. This paper explores
the significance of this similarity metric and proposes a model for accurately
estimating it. To achieve this, we leverage a dataset comprising 170k question
pairs, meticulously curated to train a similarity prediction model. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model adeptly captures
the structural similarity between questions, as evidenced by improvements in
Kendall-Tau distance and precision@k metrics. Notably, our model outperforms
strong competitive embedding models from OpenAI and Cohere. Furthermore,
compared to these competitive models, our proposed encoder enhances the
downstream performance of NL2SQL models in 1-shot in-context learning scenarios
by 1-2\% for GPT-3.5-turbo, 4-8\% for CodeLlama-7B, and 2-3\% for
CodeLlama-13B.

effectiveness and efficiency in the era of large language models. Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated commendable performance as a popular and
representative method. However, it is implemented with a fixed intrinsic rank
that might not be the ideal setting for the downstream tasks. Recognizing the
need for more flexible downstream task adaptation, we extend the methodology of
LoRA to an innovative approach we call allocating low-rank adaptation (ALoRA)
that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation
process. First, we propose a novel method, AB-LoRA, that can effectively
estimate the importance score of each LoRA rank. Second, guided by AB-LoRA, we
gradually prune abundant and negatively impacting LoRA ranks and allocate the
pruned LoRA budgets to important Transformer modules needing higher ranks. We
have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results
demonstrate that our ALoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with
comparable tunable parameters.

that place carefully crafted perturbations on normal examples to fool DNNs. To
better understand such attacks, a characterization of the features carried by
adversarial examples is needed. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by
inspecting the subspaces of sample features through spectral analysis. We first
empirically show that the features of either clean signals or adversarial
perturbations are redundant and span in low-dimensional linear subspaces
respectively with minimal overlap, and the classical low-dimensional subspace
projection can suppress perturbation features out of the subspace of clean
signals. This makes it possible for DNNs to learn a subspace where only
features of clean signals exist while those of perturbations are discarded,
which can facilitate the distinction of adversarial examples. To prevent the
residual perturbations that is inevitable in subspace learning, we propose an
independence criterion to disentangle clean signals from perturbations.
Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables the model to
inherently suppress adversaries, which not only boosts model robustness but
also motivates new directions of effective adversarial defense.

                                        <span>  Hallucinations in vision-language models pose a significant challenge to
their reliability, particularly in the generation of long captions. Current
methods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these
hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel
unsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of
hallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated
tokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated
caption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image.
This semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of
token-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL
computes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity
of aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs
a proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes
hallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our
framework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2
by 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric. This improvement is achieved
solely through signals derived from the image itself, without the need for any
image-text pairs.

dataset specifically for the Korean language. To address this, we utilized
ChatGPT to assist in constructing the KBMC (Korean Bio-Medical Corpus), which
we are now presenting to the public. With the KBMC dataset, we noticed an

on general Korean NER datasets. This research underscores the significant
benefits and importance of using specialized tools and datasets, like ChatGPT,
to enhance language processing in specialized fields such as healthcare.

question of what happens to a dataset transformed by such a method. A
theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world and synthetic data show that
these methods inject strong statistical dependencies into the transformed
datasets. After applying such a method, the representation space is highly
structured: in the transformed space, an instance tends to be located near
instances of the opposite label. As a consequence, the original labeling can in
some cases be reconstructed by applying an anti-clustering method.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive web-crawled corpora. This
poses risks of leakage, including personal information, copyrighted texts, and
benchmark datasets. Such leakage leads to undermining human trust in AI due to
potential unauthorized generation of content or overestimation of performance.
We establish the following three criteria concerning the leakage issues: (1)
leakage rate: the proportion of leaked data in training data, (2) output rate:
the ease of generating leaked data, and (3) detection rate: the detection
performance of leaked versus non-leaked data. Despite the leakage rate being
the origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the
output rate and detection rate. In this paper, we conduct an experimental
survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the
output rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and
benchmark data. Additionally, we propose a self-detection approach that uses
few-shot learning in which LLMs detect whether instances are present or absent
in their training data, in contrast to previous methods that do not employ
explicit learning. To explore the ease of generating leaked information, we
create a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information,
copyrighted text, and benchmarks from LLMs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs
produce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their
training set. This indicates even small amounts of leaked data can greatly
affect outputs. Our self-detection method showed superior performance compared
to existing detection methods.

highlighting the complexity of linguistic phenomena such as polysemy and
homonymy and their implications for computational models. Focusing extensively
on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), it outlines diverse approaches ranging from
deep learning techniques to leveraging lexical resources and knowledge graphs
like WordNet. The paper introduces cutting-edge methodologies like word sense
extension (WSE) and neuromyotonic approaches, enhancing disambiguation accuracy
by predicting new word senses. It examines specific applications in biomedical
disambiguation and language specific optimisation and discusses the
significance of cognitive metaphors in discourse analysis. The research
identifies persistent challenges in the field, such as the scarcity of sense
annotated corpora and the complexity of informal clinical texts. It concludes
by suggesting future directions, including using large language models, visual
WSD, and multilingual WSD systems, emphasising the ongoing evolution in
addressing lexical complexities in NLP. This thinking perspective highlights
the advancement in this field to enable computers to understand language more
accurately.

instruction fine-tuned model focusing on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) in
the Thai language. Our model is based on SEA-LION and a collection of
instruction following datasets. To promote open research and reproducibility,
we publically release all training data, code, and the final model weights
under the Apache-2 license. To assess the contextual understanding capability,
we conducted extensive experimental studies using two Thai MRC datasets, XQuAD
and Iapp_wiki_qa_squad. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to
comprehend the context and produce an answer faithful to the reference one in
0-shot and 1-shot settings. In addition, our evaluation goes beyond the
traditional MRC. We propose a new evaluation scheme assessing the answer's
correctness, helpfulness, conciseness, and contextuality. Evaluation results
provide insight into how we can improve our model in the future. Our code is

                                        <span>  The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been
subject to extensive NLP research, due to its envisioned impact on opinion
formation, decision making, writing education, and the like. A critical task in
any such application is the assessment of an argument's quality - but it is
also particularly challenging. In this position paper, we start from a brief
survey of argument quality research, where we identify the diversity of quality
notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles towards
substantial progress on argument quality assessment. We argue that the
capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage
knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment. Rather than
just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they
need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios
as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems. We discuss the
real-world opportunities and ethical issues emerging thereby.

                                        <span>  In the field of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant advances in user intent understanding and response in
a number of specialized domains, including medicine, law, and finance. However,
in the unique domain of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the performance
enhancement of LLMs is challenged by the essential differences between its
theories and modern medicine, as well as the lack of specialized corpus
resources. In this paper, we aim to construct and organize a professional
corpus in the field of TCM, to endow the large model with professional
knowledge that is characteristic of TCM theory, and to successfully develop the
Qibo model based on LLaMA, which is the first LLM in the field of TCM to
undergo a complete training process from pre-training to Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT). Furthermore, we develop the Qibo-benchmark, a specialized tool for
evaluating the performance of LLMs, which is a specialized tool for evaluating
the performance of LLMs in the TCM domain. This tool will provide an important
basis for quantifying and comparing the understanding and application
capabilities of different models in the field of traditional Chinese medicine,
and provide guidance for future research directions and practical applications
of intelligent assistants for traditional Chinese medicine. Finally, we
conducted sufficient experiments to prove that Qibo has good performance in the
field of traditional Chinese medicine.

                                        <span>  Performance of large language models (LLMs) may vary with different prompts
or instructions of even the same task. One commonly recognized factor for this
phenomenon is the model's familiarity with the given prompt or instruction,
which is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt
with the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible
prompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),
an end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions
into their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase
LM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or
instruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The
ensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt
without altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the
perplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in
detail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding
schemes of MonoPara. Notably, MonoPara does not require any training and can
monotonically lower the perplexity of the paraphrased prompt or instruction,
leading to improved performance of zero-shot LM prompting as evaluated on a
wide selection of tasks. In addition, MonoPara is also shown to effectively
improve LMs' generalization on perturbed and unseen task instructions.

domains and applications. Prior graph neural network models primarily focused
on extracting task-specific structural features through supervised learning
objectives, but they fell short in capturing the inherent semantic and
structural features of the entire graph. In this paper, we introduce the
semantic-structural attention-enhanced graph convolutional network (SSA-GCN),
which not only models the graph structure but also extracts generalized
unsupervised features to enhance vertex classification performance. The
SSA-GCN's key contributions lie in three aspects: firstly, it derives semantic
information through unsupervised feature extraction from a knowledge graph
perspective; secondly, it obtains structural information through unsupervised
feature extraction from a complex network perspective; and finally, it
integrates these features through a cross-attention mechanism. By leveraging
these features, we augment the graph convolutional network, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization capabilities. Our experiments on the Cora and
CiteSeer datasets demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by our
proposed method. Furthermore, our approach also exhibits excellent accuracy
under privacy settings, making it a robust and effective solution for graph
data analysis.

from mental health service platform have achieved preliminary success,
challenges persist in areas such as data scarcity, quality, and ensuring a
solid foundation in psychological techniques. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel approach to enhance the precision and efficacy of
psychological support through large language models. Specifically, we design a
specific prompt derived from principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
and have generated the CBT QA dataset, specifically for Chinese psychological
health Q&A based on CBT structured intervention strategies. Unlike previous
methods, our dataset emphasizes professional and structured response. Utilizing
this dataset, we fine-tuned the large language model, giving birth to CBT-LLM,
the large-scale language model specifically designed for Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy techniques. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CBT-LLM excels in
generating structured, professional, and highly relevant responses in
psychological health support tasks, showcasing its practicality and quality.

                                        <span>  The burgeoning integration of 3D medical imaging into healthcare has led to a
substantial increase in the workload of medical professionals. To assist
clinicians in their diagnostic processes and alleviate their workload, the
development of a robust system for retrieving similar case studies presents a
viable solution. While the concept holds great promise, the field of 3D medical
text-image retrieval is currently limited by the absence of robust evaluation
benchmarks and curated datasets. To remedy this, our study presents a
groundbreaking dataset, BIMCV-R (This dataset will be released upon
acceptance.), which includes an extensive collection of 8,069 3D CT volumes,
encompassing over 2 million slices, paired with their respective radiological
reports. Expanding upon the foundational work of our dataset, we craft a
retrieval strategy, MedFinder. This approach employs a dual-stream network
architecture, harnessing the potential of large language models to advance the
field of medical image retrieval beyond existing text-image retrieval
solutions. It marks our preliminary step towards developing a system capable of
facilitating text-to-image, image-to-text, and keyword-based retrieval tasks.

forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find
objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects
(e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar
in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we
propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This
approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant
with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their

automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have

unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned

i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the
credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw
Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that
can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and
difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic
framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors,
and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data,
specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With
the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets
constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream
learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label
errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

language understanding and the capacity to generate responses that follow
specific prompts. However, due to the computational demands associated with
training these models, their applications often adopt a zero-shot setting. In
this paper, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of two publicly accessible
LLMs, ChatGPT and OpenAssistant, in the context of six Computational Social
Science classification tasks, while also investigating the effects of various
prompting strategies. Our experiments investigate the impact of prompt
complexity, including the effect of incorporating label definitions into the
prompt; use of synonyms for label names; and the influence of integrating past
memories during foundation model training. The findings indicate that in a
zero-shot setting, current LLMs are unable to match the performance of smaller,
fine-tuned baseline transformer models (such as BERT-large). Additionally, we
find that different prompting strategies can significantly affect
classification accuracy, with variations in accuracy and F1 scores exceeding
10\%.

model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is
the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language
models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to
improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial
aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration
methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical
for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during
test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through
a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects
the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature
dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average
Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration
error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),
for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through
extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show
that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning
without needing labeled data. The code is publicly accessible at

window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of
extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often
underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these
challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We
generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by
ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby
overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific
lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond
the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with
impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be
seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such
as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference
latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the
context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration
in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench
benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance
against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to
32k. Our code is available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/CLEX.

                                        <span>  Previous studies have highlighted the importance of vaccination as an
effective strategy to control the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. It is
crucial for policymakers to have a comprehensive understanding of the public's
stance towards vaccination on a large scale. However, attitudes towards
COVID-19 vaccination, such as pro-vaccine or vaccine hesitancy, have evolved
over time on social media. Thus, it is necessary to account for possible
temporal shifts when analysing these stances. This study aims to examine the
impact of temporal concept drift on stance detection towards COVID-19
vaccination on Twitter. To this end, we evaluate a range of transformer-based
models using chronological (splitting the training, validation, and test sets
in order of time) and random splits (randomly splitting these three sets) of
social media data. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies in model
performance between random and chronological splits in several existing
COVID-19-related datasets; specifically, chronological splits significantly
reduce the accuracy of stance classification. Therefore, real-world stance
detection approaches need to be further refined to incorporate temporal factors
as a key consideration.

codes from textual prompts. However, existing benchmarks have mainly
concentrated on translating English prompts to multilingual codes or have been
constrained to very limited natural languages (NLs). These benchmarks have
overlooked the vast landscape of massively multilingual NL to multilingual
code, leaving a critical gap in the evaluation of multilingual LLMs. In
response, we introduce HumanEval-XL, a massively multilingual code generation
benchmark specifically crafted to address this deficiency. HumanEval-XL
establishes connections between 23 NLs and 12 programming languages (PLs), and
comprises of a collection of 22,080 prompts with an average of 8.33 test cases.
By ensuring parallel data across multiple NLs and PLs, HumanEval-XL offers a
comprehensive evaluation platform for multilingual LLMs, allowing the
assessment of the understanding of different NLs. Our work serves as a
pioneering step towards filling the void in evaluating NL generalization in the
area of multilingual code generation. We make our evaluation code and data

phonetic word embedding methods, we also contribute a task suite to fairly
evaluate past, current, and future methods. We evaluate both (1) intrinsic

predicting confusing charges based on fact descriptions. While existing charge
prediction methods have shown impressive performance, they face significant
challenges when dealing with confusing charges, such as Snatch and Robbery. In
the legal domain, constituent elements play a pivotal role in distinguishing
confusing charges. Constituent elements are fundamental behaviors underlying
criminal punishment and have subtle distinctions among charges. In this paper,
we introduce a novel From Graph to Word Bag (FWGB) approach, which introduces
domain knowledge regarding constituent elements to guide the model in making
judgments on confusing charges, much like a judge's reasoning process.
Specifically, we first construct a legal knowledge graph containing constituent
elements to help select keywords for each charge, forming a word bag.
Subsequently, to guide the model's attention towards the differentiating
information for each charge within the context, we expand the attention
mechanism and introduce a new loss function with attention supervision through
words in the word bag. We construct the confusing charges dataset from
real-world judicial documents. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, especially in maintaining exceptional performance in imbalanced label
distributions.

urban planning and sustainable development. We are witnessing a rising trend of
LLMs for various fields, especially dealing with multi-modal data research such
as vision-language learning, where the text modality serves as a supplement
information for the image. Since textual modality has never been introduced
into modality combinations in urban region profiling, we aim to answer two
fundamental questions in this paper: i) Can textual modality enhance urban
region profiling? ii) and if so, in what ways and with regard to which aspects?
To answer the questions, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs)
and introduce the first-ever LLM-enhanced framework that integrates the
knowledge of textual modality into urban imagery profiling, named LLM-enhanced
Urban Region Profiling with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (UrbanCLIP).
Specifically, it first generates a detailed textual description for each
satellite image by an open-source Image-to-Text LLM. Then, the model is trained
on the image-text pairs, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for
urban visual representation learning, jointly with contrastive loss and
language modeling loss. Results on predicting three urban indicators in four
major Chinese metropolises demonstrate its superior performance, with an
average improvement of 6.1% on R^2 compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code and the image-language dataset will be released upon paper

                                        <span>  Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized Natural
Language Processing (NLP), showing potential in traditional tasks such as Named
Entity Recognition (NER). Our study explores a three-phase training strategy
that harnesses GPT-4's capabilities to enhance the BERT model's performance on
NER. Initially, GPT-4 annotates a subset of the CONLL2003 and additional BBC
dataset without fine-tuning. We then train BERT using a mix of original and
LLM-annotated data, analyzing the efficacy of LLM annotations against
traditional methods. The second phase involves comparative experiments with
different training regimens, assessing the synergy between distilled and
original data. We observe that sequential strategies, particularly a simple mix
of training first with distilled data followed by original data, significantly
boost performance. In the third phase, we investigate various data blending
techniques, including sigmoid and power decay functions, to optimize the
training process further. Our results indicate that a strategic mix of
distilled and original data markedly elevates the NER capabilities of BERT. Our
approach presents a scalable methodology that reduces manual annotation costs
and increases efficiency, making it especially pertinent in resource-limited
and closed-network environments. The study concludes that while the 'Simple
Mix' strategy yields the best results, understanding its underlying mechanisms
requires further research. Future work will also focus on refining prompt
designs and enhancing annotation selection processes, aiming to extend our
methodology to diverse NLP tasks.

Red-Teaming or Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
crucial area of study. This approach is especially significant in terms of
assessing and enhancing the safety and robustness of these models. This paper
investigates the intricate consequences of such modifications through model
editing, uncovering a complex relationship between enhancing model accuracy and
preserving its ethical integrity. Our in-depth analysis reveals a striking
paradox: while injecting accurate information is crucial for model reliability,
it can paradoxically destabilize the model's foundational framework, resulting
in unpredictable and potentially unsafe behaviors. Additionally, we propose a
benchmark dataset NicheHazardQA to investigate this unsafe behavior both within
the same and cross topical domain. This aspect of our research sheds light on
how the edits, impact the model's safety metrics and guardrails. Our findings
show that model editing serves as a cost-effective tool for topical red-teaming
by methodically applying targeted edits and evaluating the resultant model
behavior.

various tasks, they often struggle with hallucination problems, especially in
scenarios requiring deep and responsible reasoning. These issues could be
partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM
reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm
``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to
interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform
reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm
by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM
agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising
reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number
of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages
of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has
the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by
leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible
plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies
without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM
models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this
reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method
with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA
in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.

                                        <span>  Deep multimodal semantic understanding that goes beyond the mere superficial
content relation mining has received increasing attention in the realm of
artificial intelligence. The challenges of collecting and annotating
high-quality multi-modal data have underscored the significance of few-shot
learning. In this paper, we focus on two critical tasks under this context:
few-shot multi-modal sarcasm detection (MSD) and multi-modal sentiment analysis
(MSA). To address them, we propose Mixture-of-Prompt-Experts with Block-Aware
Prompt Fusion (MoPE-BAF), a novel multi-modal soft prompt framework based on
the unified vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, we design three experts
of soft prompts: a text prompt and an image prompt that extract
modality-specific features to enrich the single-modal representation, and a
unified prompt to assist multi-modal interaction. Additionally, we reorganize
Transformer layers into several blocks and introduce cross-modal prompt
attention between adjacent blocks, which smoothens the transition from
single-modal representation to multi-modal fusion. On both MSD and MSA datasets
in few-shot setting, our proposed model not only surpasses the 8.2B model
InstructBLIP with merely 2% parameters (150M), but also significantly
outperforms other widely-used prompt methods on VLMs or task-specific methods.

generalizability across various domains. However, their reasoning abilities
still have significant room for improvement, especially when confronted with
scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning. Although large language models
possess extensive knowledge, their reasoning often fails to effectively utilize
this knowledge to establish a coherent thinking paradigm. These models
sometimes show hallucinations as their reasoning procedures are unconstrained
by logical principles. Aiming at improving the zero-shot chain-of-thought
reasoning ability of large language models, we propose LoT (Logical Thoughts),
a self-improvement prompting framework that leverages principles rooted in
symbolic logic, particularly Reductio ad Absurdum, to systematically verify and
rectify the reasoning processes step by step. Experimental evaluations
conducted on language tasks in diverse domains, including arithmetic,
commonsense, symbolic, causal inference, and social problems, demonstrate the
efficacy of enhanced reasoning by logic. The implementation code for LoT can be

generation. While achieving significant advances, they blur the distinctions
between machine- and human-authored source code, causing integrity and
authenticity issues of software artifacts. Previous methods such as DetectGPT
have proven effective in discerning machine-generated texts, but they do not
identify and harness the unique patterns of machine-generated code. Thus, its
applicability falters when applied to code. In this paper, we carefully study
the specific patterns that characterize machine- and human-authored code.
Through a rigorous analysis of code attributes such as lexical diversity,
conciseness, and naturalness, we expose unique patterns inherent to each
source. We particularly notice that the syntactic segmentation of code is a
critical factor in identifying its provenance. Based on our findings, we
propose DetectCodeGPT, a novel method for detecting machine-generated code,
which improves DetectGPT by capturing the distinct stylized patterns of code.
Diverging from conventional techniques that depend on external LLMs for
perturbations, DetectCodeGPT perturbs the code corpus by strategically
inserting spaces and newlines, ensuring both efficacy and efficiency.
Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques in detecting machine-generated code.

                                        <span>  A crucial aspect of a rumor detection model is its ability to generalize,
particularly its ability to detect emerging, previously unknown rumors. Past
research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as
input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen
rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely
untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of
the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on
detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that
context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from
the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that
contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split
strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the
paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of
temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor
detection methods.

                                        <span>  The advent of Vision Language Models (VLM) has allowed researchers to
investigate the visual understanding of a neural network using natural
language. Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of
visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the
question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently unreasonable?
To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical
illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two
distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization.
GPT4V, the best-performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the
comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and
Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03% and 100%
accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context
Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the
performance of GeminiPro on the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a
potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical
illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot
example.

sequence for input tokens. While the original transformer paper's method has
shown satisfactory results in general language processing tasks, there have
been new proposals, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), for further
improvement. This paper presents geotokens, input components for transformers,
each linked to a specific geological location. Unlike typical language
sequences, for these tokens, the order is not as vital as the geographical
coordinates themselves. To represent the relative position in this context and
to keep a balance between the real world distance and the distance in the
embedding space, we design a position encoding approach drawing from the RoPE
structure but tailored for spherical coordinates.

smaller, application-specific models, significantly reducing operational costs
and manual labor. Addressing the challenge of deploying computationally
intensive LLMs in specific applications or edge devices, this technique
utilizes LLMs' reasoning capabilities to generate labels and natural language
rationales for unlabeled data. Our approach enhances both finetuning and
distillation by employing a multi-task training framework where student models
mimic these rationales alongside teacher predictions. Key contributions include
the employment of zero-shot prompting to elicit teacher model rationales,
reducing the necessity for handcrafted few-shot examples and lowering the
overall token count required, which directly translates to cost savings given
the pay-per-token billing model of major tech companies' LLM APIs.
Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of explanation properties on
distillation efficiency, demonstrating that minimal performance loss occurs
even when rationale augmentation is not applied across the entire dataset,
facilitating further reductions of tokens. This research marks a step toward
the efficient training of task-specific models with minimal human intervention,
offering substantial cost-savings while maintaining, or even enhancing,
performance.

languages, such as GLUE for English, CLUE for Chinese, KLUE for Korean, and
IndoNLU for Indonesian, has facilitated the evaluation of new NLU models across
a wide range of tasks. To establish a standardized set of benchmarks for
Vietnamese NLU, we introduce the first Vietnamese Language Understanding
Evaluation (VLUE) benchmark. The VLUE benchmark encompasses five datasets
covering different NLU tasks, including text classification, span extraction,
and natural language understanding. To provide an insightful overview of the
current state of Vietnamese NLU, we then evaluate seven state-of-the-art
pre-trained models, including both multilingual and Vietnamese monolingual
models, on our proposed VLUE benchmark. Furthermore, we present CafeBERT, a new
state-of-the-art pre-trained model that achieves superior results across all
tasks in the VLUE benchmark. Our model combines the proficiency of a
multilingual pre-trained model with Vietnamese linguistic knowledge. CafeBERT
is developed based on the XLM-RoBERTa model, with an additional pretraining
step utilizing a significant amount of Vietnamese textual data to enhance its
adaptation to the Vietnamese language. For the purpose of future research,
CafeBERT is made publicly available for research purposes.

                                        <span>  Move structures have been studied in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and
English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for decades. However, there are few move
annotation corpora for Research Article (RA) abstracts. In this paper, we
introduce RAAMove, a comprehensive multi-domain corpus dedicated to the
annotation of move structures in RA abstracts. The primary objective of RAAMove
is to facilitate move analysis and automatic move identification. This paper
provides a thorough discussion of the corpus construction process, including
the scheme, data collection, annotation guidelines, and annotation procedures.
The corpus is constructed through two stages: initially, expert annotators
manually annotate high-quality data; subsequently, based on the human-annotated
data, a BERT-based model is employed for automatic annotation with the help of
experts' modification. The result is a large-scale and high-quality corpus
comprising 33,988 annotated instances. We also conduct preliminary move
identification experiments using the BERT-based model to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed corpus and model. The annotated corpus is
available for academic research purposes and can serve as essential resources
for move analysis, English language teaching and writing, as well as
move/discourse-related tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

straightforward, and effective technique for masking image patches during
pre-training of a vision-language model. GLIP builds on Fast Language-Image
Pre-Training (FLIP), which randomly masks image patches while training a CLIP
model. GLIP replaces random masking with centered masking, that uses a Gaussian
distribution and is inspired by the importance of image patches at the center
of the image. GLIP retains the same computational savings as FLIP, while
improving performance across a range of downstream datasets and tasks, as
demonstrated by our experimental results. We show the benefits of GLIP to be
easy to obtain, requiring no delicate tuning of the Gaussian, and also
applicable to data sets containing images without an obvious center focus.

computing sentence-level metrics using multilingual large language models. The
metrics developed sentence surprisal and sentence relevance and then are tested
and compared to validate whether they can predict how humans comprehend
sentences as a whole across languages. These metrics offer significant
interpretability and achieve high accuracy in predicting human sentence reading
speeds. Our results indicate that these computational sentence-level metrics
are exceptionally effective at predicting and elucidating the processing
difficulties encountered by readers in comprehending sentences as a whole
across a variety of languages. Their impressive performance and generalization

indispensable, playing a crucial role in developing medical knowledge graphs,
enhancing medical question-answering systems, and analyzing electronic medical
records. The challenge in medical NER arises from the complex nested structures
and sophisticated medical terminologies, distinguishing it from its
counterparts in traditional domains. In response to these complexities, we
propose a medical NER model based on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), which
uses a task-adaptive pre-training strategy to improve the model's capability in
the medical field. Meanwhile, our model introduces multiple word-pair
embeddings and multi-granularity dilated convolution to enhance the model's
representation ability and uses a combined predictor of Biaffine and MLP to
improve the model's recognition performance. Experimental evaluations conducted
on the CMeEE, a benchmark for Chinese nested medical NER, demonstrate that our
proposed model outperforms the compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

                                        <span>  Recent studies have put into question the belief that emergent abilities in
language models are exclusive to large models. This skepticism arises from two
observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent
abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure
these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the
lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We
demonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different
model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream
tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain
tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss
falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its
performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to
redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower
pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by
merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training
losses.

                                        <span>  Headline generation aims to summarize a long document with a short, catchy
title that reflects the main idea. This requires accurately capturing the core
document semantics, which is challenging due to the lengthy and background
information-rich na ture of the texts. In this work, We propose using a unified
semantic discourse structure (S3) to represent document semantics, achieved by
combining document-level rhetorical structure theory (RST) trees with
sentence-level abstract meaning representation (AMR) graphs to construct S3
graphs. The hierarchical composition of sentence, clause, and word
intrinsically characterizes the semantic meaning of the overall document. We
then develop a headline generation framework, in which the S3 graphs are
encoded as contextual features. To consolidate the efficacy of S3 graphs, we
further devise a hierarchical structure pruning mechanism to dynamically screen
the redundant and nonessential nodes within the graph. Experimental results on
two headline generation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-art methods consistently. Our work can be instructive for a
broad range of document modeling tasks, more than headline or summarization
generation.

for a user, it is natural for dissatisfaction to arise. The problem is, that
even if users are dissatisfied, they often do not have the means to resolve
their dissatisfaction. The user cannot alter the source code of the service,
nor can they force the service provider to change. The user has no choice but
to remain dissatisfied or quit the service. User-side realization offers
proactive solutions to this problem by providing general algorithms to deal
with common problems on the user's side. These algorithms run on the user's
side and solve the problems without having the service provider change the

                                        <span>  Preliminary security risk analysis (PSRA) provides a quick approach to
identify, evaluate and propose remeditation to potential risks in specific
scenarios. The extensive expertise required for an effective PSRA and the
substantial ammount of textual-related tasks hinder quick assessments in
mission-critical contexts, where timely and prompt actions are essential. The
speed and accuracy of human experts in PSRA significantly impact response time.
A large language model can quickly summarise information in less time than a
human. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored the capabilities of
fine-tuned models (FTM) in PSRA. Our case study investigates the proficiency of
FTM to assist practitioners in PSRA. We manually curated 141 representative
samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial
context team in the last five years.We compared the proficiency of the FTM
versus seven human experts. Within the industrial context, our approach has
proven successful in reducing errors in PSRA, hastening security risk
detection, and minimizing false positives and negatives. This translates to
cost savings for the company by averting unnecessary expenses associated with
implementing unwarranted countermeasures. Therefore, experts can focus on more
comprehensive risk analysis, leveraging LLMs for an effective preliminary
assessment within a condensed timeframe.

                                        <span>  Active learning (AL) techniques aim to maximally utilize a labeling budget by
iteratively selecting instances that are most likely to improve prediction
accuracy. However, their benefit compared to random sampling has not been
consistent across various setups, e.g., different datasets, classifiers. In
this empirical study, we examine how a combination of different factors might
obscure any gains from an AL technique.
  Focusing on text classification, we rigorously evaluate AL techniques over
around 1000 experiments that vary wrt the dataset, batch size, text
representation and the classifier. We show that AL is only effective in a
narrow set of circumstances. We also address the problem of using metrics that
are better aligned with real world expectations.
  The impact of this study is in its insights for a practitioner: (a) the
choice of text representation and classifier is as important as that of an AL
technique, (b) choice of the right metric is critical in assessment of the
latter, and, finally, (c) reported AL results must be holistically interpreted,
accounting for variables other than just the query strategy.

crawled from the web and fed to LLMs. How can \textit{\textbf{everyday web
users}} confirm if LLMs misuse their data without permission? In this work, we
suggest that users repeatedly insert personal passphrases into their documents,
enabling LLMs to memorize them. These concealed passphrases in user documents,
referred to as \textit{ghost sentences}, once they are identified in the
generated content of LLMs, users can be sure that their data is used for
training. To explore the effectiveness and usage of this copyrighting tool, we
define the \textit{user training data identification} task with ghost
sentences. Multiple datasets from various sources at different scales are
created and tested with LLMs of different sizes. For evaluation, we introduce a
last $k$ words verification manner along with two metrics: document and user
identification accuracy. In the specific case of instruction tuning of a 3B
LLaMA model, 11 out of 16 users with ghost sentences identify their data within
the generation content. These 16 users contribute 383 examples to $\sim$1.8M
training documents. For continuing pre-training of a 1.1B TinyLlama model, 61
out of 64 users with ghost sentences identify their data within the LLM output.
These 64 users contribute 1156 examples to $\sim$10M training documents.

                                        <span>  The interest in updating Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining from
scratch is substantial, yet it comes with some challenges.This is especially
true for situations demanding complex reasoning with limited samples, a
scenario we refer to as the Paucity-Constrained Complex Reasoning Adaptation
for LLMs (PCRA-LLM).Traditional methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are inadequate for this critical issue,
particularly evident in our exploration of a specific medical context that
epitomize the PCRA-LLM's distinct needs.To address the issue, we propose a
Sequential Fusion method to incorporate knowledge from complex context into
LLMs. This method employs a two-stage framework: initially, it leverages
general LLMs to construct knowledge graphs (KGs) for extracting knowledge from
complex texts; subsequently, it updates the domain LLMs through knowledge edit.
According to our method, the domain LLM achieved a 71.69\% accuracy in question
answering tasks. Subsequently, we broadened our assessment to a novel dataset
we developed in the economics and management field, where our method realized a
75\% accuracy. These outcomes underline the efficacy and adaptability of our
approach for PCRA-LLM across various domains.

papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand
significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and
utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new
collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under
development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively
references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for
collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a
comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information;
second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries
enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe
the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to
assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of
prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and
accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain,
which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures
efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility
for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This
innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast
datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering
researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to
explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.

                                        <span>  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an established task with the objective
of identifying the text present in an image. While many off-the-shelf OCR
models exist, they are often trained for either scientific (e.g., formulae) or
generic printed English text. Extracting text from chemistry publications
requires an OCR model that is capable in both realms. Nougat, a recent tool,
exhibits strong ability to parse academic documents, but is unable to parse
tables in PubMed articles, which comprises a significant part of the academic
community and is the focus of this work. To mitigate this gap, we present the
Printed English and Chemical Equations (PEaCE) dataset, containing both
synthetic and real-world records, and evaluate the efficacy of
transformer-based OCR models when trained on this resource. Given that
real-world records contain artifacts not present in synthetic records, we
propose transformations that mimic such qualities. We perform a suite of
experiments to explore the impact of patch size, multi-domain training, and our
proposed transformations, ultimately finding that models with a small patch
size trained on multiple domains using the proposed transformations yield the
best performance. Our dataset and code is available at

given target. Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) has emerged to classify stances
towards unseen targets during inference. Recent data augmentation techniques
for ZSSD increase transferable knowledge between targets through text or target
augmentation. However, these methods exhibit limitations. Target augmentation
lacks logical connections between generated targets and source text, while text
augmentation relies solely on training data, resulting in insufficient
generalization. To address these issues, we propose an encoder-decoder data
augmentation (EDDA) framework. The encoder leverages large language models and
chain-of-thought prompting to summarize texts into target-specific if-then
rationales, establishing logical relationships. The decoder generates new
samples based on these expressions using a semantic correlation word
replacement strategy to increase syntactic diversity. We also analyze the
generated expressions to develop a rationale-enhanced network that fully
utilizes the augmented data. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate our
approach substantially improves over state-of-the-art ZSSD techniques. The
proposed EDDA framework increases semantic relevance and syntactic variety in
augmented texts while enabling interpretable rationale-based learning.

effec-tively assist the user in mitigating emotional pressures. However, owing
to the inherent subjectivity involved in analyzing emotions, current
non-artificial methodologies face challenges in effectively appraising the
emo-tional support capability. These metrics exhibit a low correlation with
human judgments. Concurrently, manual evaluation methods extremely will cause
high costs. To solve these problems, we propose a novel model FEEL (Framework
for Evaluating Emotional Support Capability with Large Lan-guage Models),
employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess emotional
support capabilities. The model meticulously considers var-ious evaluative
aspects of ESC to apply a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation method for
ESC. Additionally, it employs a probability distribu-tion approach for a more
stable result and integrates an ensemble learning strategy, leveraging multiple
LLMs with assigned weights to enhance evalua-tion accuracy. To appraise the
performance of FEEL, we conduct extensive experiments on existing ESC model
dialogues. Experimental results demon-strate our model exhibits a substantial
enhancement in alignment with human evaluations compared to the baselines. Our

focuses on monolingual relation extraction or cross-lingual enhancement for
relation extraction. Yet, there remains a significant gap in understanding
relation extraction in the mix-lingual (or code-switching) scenario, where
individuals intermix contents from different languages within sentences,
generating mix-lingual content. Due to the lack of a dedicated dataset, the
effectiveness of existing relation extraction models in such a scenario is
largely unexplored. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task of

constructing the human-annotated dataset MixRED to support this task. In
addition to constructing the MixRED dataset, we evaluate both state-of-the-art

we delve into factors influencing model performance within the MixRE task and
uncover promising directions for enhancing the performance of both supervised

proposed framework, EAGLE, leverages the labeled data that is available so far
from older language models and learns features invariant across these
generators, in order to detect text generated by an unknown target generator.
EAGLE learns such domain-invariant features by combining the representational
power of self-supervised contrastive learning with domain adversarial training.
Through our experiments we demonstrate how EAGLE effectively achieves
impressive performance in detecting text generated by unseen target generators,
including recent state-of-the-art ones such as GPT-4 and Claude, reaching
detection scores of within 4.7% of a fully supervised detector.

                                        <span>  ZKP systems have surged attention and held a fundamental role in contemporary
cryptography. Zk-SNARK protocols dominate the ZKP usage, often implemented
through arithmetic circuit programming paradigm. However, underconstrained or
overconstrained circuits may lead to bugs. Underconstrained circuits refer to
circuits that lack the necessary constraints, resulting in unexpected solutions
in the circuit and causing the verifier to accept a bogus witness.
Overconstrained circuits refer to circuits that are constrained excessively,
resulting in the circuit lacking necessary solutions and causing the verifier
to accept no witness, rendering the circuit meaningless. This paper introduces
a novel approach for pinpointing two distinct types of bugs in ZKP circuits.
The method involves encoding the arithmetic circuit constraints to polynomial
equation systems and solving polynomial equation systems over a finite field by
algebraic computation. The classification of verification results is refined,
greatly enhancing the expressive power of the system. We proposed a tool, AC4,
to represent the implementation of this method. Experiments demonstrate that
AC4 represents a substantial 29% increase in the checked ratio compared to
prior work. Within a solvable range, the checking time of AC4 has also
exhibited noticeable improvement, demonstrating a magnitude increase compared
to previous efforts.

the molecular level, predicting chemical or protein structures, and further
extending to societal predictions like infectious disease outbreaks. Recent
advancements in large language models, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, have
showcased significant prowess in natural language tasks, such as translating

sequences: biomedical literature and health records presented as text,
biological sequences or sequencing data arranged in sequences, or sensor data
like brain signals as time series. The question arises: Can we harness the
potential of recent large language models to drive biomedical knowledge
discoveries? In this survey, we will explore the application of large language
models to three crucial categories of biomedical data: 1) textual data, 2)
biological sequences, and 3) brain signals. Furthermore, we will delve into
large language model challenges in biomedical research, including ensuring

language models (LMs), end-task evaluations often conflate notions of *factual
accuracy* ("truth") and *reasoning ability* ("rationality", or "honesty" in the
sense of correctly reporting implications of beliefs). Our goal is a dataset
that clearly distinguishes these two notions. Our approach is to leverage and
extend a collection of human-annotated *entailment trees*, engineered to
express both good and bad chains of reasoning, and using a mixture of true and
false facts, in particular including counterfactual examples, to avoid belief
bias (also known as the "content effect"). The resulting dataset, called BaRDa,
contains 3000 entailments (1787 valid, 1213 invalid), using 6681 true and 2319
false statements. Testing on four GPT-series models,
GPT3(curie)/GPT3(davinici)/3.5/4, we find factual accuracy (truth) scores of
74.1/80.6/82.6/87.1 and reasoning accuracy scores of 63.1/78.0/71.8/79.2. This
shows the clear progression of models towards improved factual accuracy and
entailment reasoning, and the dataset provides a new benchmark that more
cleanly separates and quantifies these two notions.

still fall short in their ability to reason robustly in complex settings.
However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities
continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have
remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on
multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This
dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel
neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the
construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder
mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more
capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text
narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it
simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted
benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to
solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques
on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like
chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.

most research has concentrated on civil law cases rather than case law systems.
We identified two unique challenges in making legal case outcome predictions
with case law. First, it is crucial to identify relevant precedent cases that
serve as fundamental evidence for judges during decision-making. Second, it is
necessary to consider the evolution of legal principles over time, as early
cases may adhere to different legal contexts. In this paper, we proposed a new
framework named PILOT (PredictIng Legal case OuTcome) for case outcome
prediction. It comprises two modules for relevant case retrieval and temporal
pattern handling, respectively. To benchmark the performance of existing legal
case outcome prediction models, we curated a dataset from a large-scale case
law database. We demonstrate the importance of accurately identifying precedent
cases and mitigating the temporal shift when making predictions for case law,
as our method shows a significant improvement over the prior methods that focus
on civil law case outcome predictions.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have come closest among all models to date to
mastering human language, yet opinions about their linguistic and cognitive
capabilities remain split. Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between
formal linguistic competence - knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns - and
functional linguistic competence - understanding and using language in the
world. We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that
formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although
LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on
functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized
fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that
use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence
types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of mechanisms specialized
for formal linguistic competence, distinct from functional competence.

                                        <span>  The task of predicting multiple links within knowledge graphs (KGs) stands as
a challenge in the field of knowledge graph analysis, a challenge increasingly
resolvable due to advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and KG
embedding techniques. This paper introduces a novel methodology, the Knowledge
Graph Large Language Model Framework (KG-LLM), which leverages pivotal NLP
paradigms, including chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning
(ICL), to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to a
CoT prompt, our framework is designed to discern and learn the latent
representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of
the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading Large Language Models (LLMs)
within this framework, employing both non-ICL and ICL tasks for a comprehensive
evaluation. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with
zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Our experimental
findings discover that integrating ICL and CoT not only augments the
performance of our approach but also significantly boosts the models'
generalization capacity, thereby ensuring more precise predictions in
unfamiliar scenarios.

language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to reshape many other
fields, e.g., recommender systems (RS). However, most of the related work
treats an LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g.,
as a feature extractor), which may not be able to fully leverage the generative
power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple
stages, such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be
simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the
complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods, and future
directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions:
1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative
recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for
various RS tasks. We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance
needed to explore this interesting and emerging topic.

                                        <span>  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific
scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to
fulfill specific needs, but the limited training samples available in practice
lead to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt
LLMs to new scenarios with few training samples is a major challenge for
current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach
named SEED, which stands for Sample-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven
learning for code generation. SEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as
learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome its own shortcomings,
thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, SEED involves identifying
error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-revise for code revision,
optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process
for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other
mainstream fine-tuning approaches, SEED achieves superior performance with few
training samples, showing an average relative improvement of 54.7% in Pass@1 on
multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of
Self-revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more
efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, SEED
consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring
its generalizability.

remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting
to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the
model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot
demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent
development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The
implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward,
leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the
efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to
reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging
results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct
an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and
compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training
procedures, and inference algorithms.

inference for narrative understanding. In this paper, we introduce K-Act2Emo, a

expressions and the emotions inferable from them. We categorize reasoning types
into inferences in positive situations, inferences in negative situations, and
inferences when expressions do not serve as emotional cues. Unlike existing
CSKGs, K-Act2Emo specializes in emotional contexts, and experimental results
validate its effectiveness for training emotion inference models.
Significantly, the BART-based knowledge model fine-tuned with K-Act2Emo
outperforms various existing Korean large language models, achieving

                                        <span>  Mathematical reasoning serves as a cornerstone for assessing the fundamental
cognitive capabilities of human intelligence. In recent times, there has been a
notable surge in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) geared towards
the automated resolution of mathematical problems. However, the landscape of
mathematical problem types is vast and varied, with LLM-oriented techniques
undergoing evaluation across diverse datasets and settings. This diversity
makes it challenging to discern the true advancements and obstacles within this
burgeoning field. This survey endeavors to address four pivotal dimensions: i)
a comprehensive exploration of the various mathematical problems and their
corresponding datasets that have been investigated; ii) an examination of the
spectrum of LLM-oriented techniques that have been proposed for mathematical
problem-solving; iii) an overview of factors and concerns affecting LLMs in
solving math; and iv) an elucidation of the persisting challenges within this
domain. To the best of our knowledge, this survey stands as one of the first
extensive examinations of the landscape of LLMs in the realm of mathematics,
providing a holistic perspective on the current state, accomplishments, and
future challenges in this rapidly evolving field.

                                        <span>  Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that aims to
identify and extract the emotional aspects of a text. However, many existing
sentiment analysis methods primarily classify the overall polarity of a text,
overlooking the specific phrases that convey sentiment. In this paper, we
applied an approach to sentiment analysis based on a question-answering
framework. Our approach leverages the power of Bidirectional Autoregressive
Transformer (BART), a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, to extract a
phrase from a given text that amplifies a given sentiment polarity. We create a
natural language question that identifies the specific emotion to extract and
then guide BART to pay attention to the relevant emotional cues in the text. We
use a classifier within BART to predict the start and end positions of the
answer span within the text, which helps to identify the precise boundaries of
the extracted emotion phrase. Our approach offers several advantages over most
sentiment analysis studies, including capturing the complete context and
meaning of the text and extracting precise token spans that highlight the
intended sentiment. We achieved an end loss of 87% and Jaccard score of 0.61.

(LLMs), understanding the semantics within their mechanisms is vital. Causal
analyses define semantics, while gradient-based methods are essential to
eXplainable AI (XAI), interpreting the model's 'black box'. Integrating these,
we investigate how a model's mechanisms reveal its causal effect on
evidence-based decision-making. Research indicates intersectionality - the
combined impact of an individual's demographics - can be framed as an Average
Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper demonstrates that hateful meme detection can
be viewed as an ATE estimation using intersectionality principles, and
summarized gradient-based attention scores highlight distinct behaviors of
three Transformer models. We further reveal that LLM Llama-2 can discern the
intersectional aspects of the detection through in-context learning and that
the learning process could be explained via meta-gradient, a secondary form of
gradient. In conclusion, this work furthers the dialogue on Causality and XAI.

significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still
struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning
performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs
to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various
self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal.
Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still
under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the
self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning,
focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We
introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies
categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on
FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models
on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs
could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall
short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from
these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical
applications of self-verification methods.

computational linguistics researchers. We identified two limitations in
previous studies. Firstly, lyric translation studies have predominantly focused
on Western genres and languages, with no previous study centering on K-pop
despite its popularity. Second, the field of lyric translation suffers from a
lack of publicly available datasets; to the best of our knowledge, no such
dataset exists. To broaden the scope of genres and languages in lyric
translation studies, we introduce a novel singable lyric translation dataset,
approximately 89\% of which consists of K-pop song lyrics. This dataset aligns
Korean and English lyrics line-by-line and section-by-section. We leveraged
this dataset to unveil unique characteristics of K-pop lyric translation,
distinguishing it from other extensively studied genres, and to construct a
neural lyric translation model, thereby underscoring the importance of a
dedicated dataset for singable lyric translations.

their model parameters. However, besides explorations on a few probing tasks in
limited knowledge domains, it is not well understood how to evaluate LLMs'
knowledge systematically and how well their knowledge abilities generalize,
across a spectrum of knowledge domains and progressively complex task formats.
To this end, we propose KGQuiz, a knowledge-intensive benchmark to
comprehensively investigate the knowledge generalization abilities of LLMs.
KGQuiz is a scalable framework constructed from triplet-based knowledge, which
covers three knowledge domains and consists of five tasks with increasing
complexity: true-or-false, multiple-choice QA, blank filling, factual editing,
and open-ended knowledge generation. To gain a better understanding of LLMs'
knowledge abilities and their generalization, we evaluate 10 open-source and
black-box LLMs on the KGQuiz benchmark across the five knowledge-intensive
tasks and knowledge domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs
achieve impressive performance in straightforward knowledge QA tasks, while
settings and contexts requiring more complex reasoning or employing
domain-specific facts still present significant challenges. We envision KGQuiz
as a testbed to analyze such nuanced variations in performance across domains
and task formats, and ultimately to understand, evaluate, and improve LLMs'
knowledge abilities across a wide spectrum of knowledge domains and tasks.

detection methods exhibit superior performance, they often lack
generalizability due to their heavy dependence on training data. To alleviate

LLM Paternity Test (LLM-Pat). Specifically, given any candidate text
(\textit{child}), LLM-Pat employs an intermediary LLM (\textit{parent}) to
reconstruct a \textit{sibling} text corresponding to the given text and then
measures the similarity between candidate texts and their sibling texts. High
similarity indicates that the candidate text is machine-generated, akin to
genetic traits. We have constructed datasets encompassing four scenarios:
student responses in educational settings, news creation, academic paper
writing, and social media bots to assess the performance of LLM-Pat. The
experiments show that LLM-Pat outperforms the existing detection methods and is
more robust against paraphrasing attacks and re-translating attacks. Besides,
LLM-Pat can also be used to trace which large language model the text was
generated by. The constructed dataset and code will be released to benefit the
community.

                                        <span>  The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs)
inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While
speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they
face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation
or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.
  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these
issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model
and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens
simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially
enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.
On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko
demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a
standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter
model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem
model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model
validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of
PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster
than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream
task accuracy.

discourse that pertain to the same real-world entity. While this task has been
extensively explored in the English language, there has been a notable scarcity
of publicly accessible resources and models for coreference resolution in South
Asian languages. We introduce a Translated dataset for Multilingual Coreference
Resolution (TransMuCoRes) in 31 South Asian languages using off-the-shelf tools
for translation and word-alignment. Nearly all of the predicted translations
successfully pass a sanity check, and 75% of English references align with
their predicted translations. Using multilingual encoders, two off-the-shelf
coreference resolution models were trained on a concatenation of TransMuCoRes
and a Hindi coreference resolution dataset with manual annotations. The best
performing model achieved a score of 64 and 68 for LEA F1 and CoNLL F1,
respectively, on our test-split of Hindi golden set. This study is the first to
evaluate an end-to-end coreference resolution model on a Hindi golden set.
Furthermore, this work underscores the limitations of current coreference
evaluation metrics when applied to datasets with split antecedents, advocating
for the development of more suitable evaluation metrics.

                                        <span>  Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate student's knowledge mastery based on
their historical interactions. Recently, the deep learning based KT (DLKT)
approaches have achieved impressive performance in the KT task. These DLKT
models heavily rely on the large number of available student interactions.
However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy
concerns, observed interactions are very limited in many real-world scenarios,
a.k.a, low-resource KT datasets. Directly training a DLKT model on a
low-resource KT dataset may lead to overfitting and it is difficult to choose
the appropriate deep neural architecture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
a low-resource KT framework called LoReKT to address above challenges. Inspired
by the prevalent "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, we aim to learn
transferable parameters and representations from rich-resource KT datasets
during the pre-training stage and subsequently facilitate effective adaptation
to low-resource KT datasets. Specifically, we simplify existing sophisticated
DLKT model architectures with purely a stack of transformer decoders. We design
an encoding mechanism to incorporate student interactions from multiple KT data
sources and develop an importance mechanism to prioritize updating parameters
with high importance while constraining less important ones during the
fine-tuning stage. We evaluate LoReKT on six public KT datasets and
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of
AUC and Accuracy. To encourage reproducible research, we make our data and code
publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LoReKT-C619.

risks such as biased content generation and privacy issues. One of the current
alignment techniques includes principle-driven integration, but it faces
challenges arising from the imprecision of manually crafted rules and
inadequate risk perception in models without safety training. To address these,
we introduce Guide-Align, a two-stage approach. Initially, a safety-trained
model identifies potential risks and formulates specific guidelines for various
inputs, establishing a comprehensive library of guidelines and a model for
input-guidelines retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval model correlates new
inputs with relevant guidelines, which guide LLMs in response generation to
ensure safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. An
additional optional stage involves fine-tuning a model with well-aligned
datasets generated through the process implemented in the second stage. Our
method customizes guidelines to accommodate diverse inputs, thereby enhancing
the fine-grainedness and comprehensiveness of the guideline library.
Furthermore, it incorporates safety expertise from a safety-trained LLM through
a lightweight retrieval model. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks,
demonstrating significant improvements in LLM security and quality. Notably,
our fine-tuned model, Labrador, even at 13 billion parameters, outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses GPT-4 in alignment capabilities.

for psychotherapists during the motivational interviewing (MI), a collaborative
communication intervention approach to address psychiatric issues, such as
alcohol and drug addiction. While the behavior coding task has rapidly adapted
machine learning to predict patient states during the MI sessions, lacking of
domain-specific knowledge and overlooking patient-therapist interactions are
major challenges in developing and deploying those models in real practice. To
encounter those challenges, we introduce the Chain-of-Interaction (CoI)
prompting method aiming to contextualize large language models (LLMs) for
psychiatric decision support by the dyadic interactions. The CoI prompting
approach systematically breaks down the coding task into three key reasoning
steps, extract patient engagement, learn therapist question strategies, and
integrates dyadic interactions between patients and therapists. This approach
enables large language models to leverage the coding scheme, patient state, and
domain knowledge for patient behavioral coding. Experiments on real-world
datasets can prove the effectiveness and flexibility of our prompting method
with multiple state-of-the-art LLMs over existing prompting baselines. We have
conducted extensive ablation analysis and demonstrate the critical role of
dyadic interactions in applying LLMs for psychotherapy behavior understanding.

Disambiguation (WSD) to extract and contrast the contextual meaning with the
basic meaning of a word to determine whether it is used metaphorically in a

                                        <span>  With the widespread use of language models (LMs) in NLP tasks, researchers
have discovered the potential of Chain-of-thought (CoT) to assist LMs in
accomplishing complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate steps.
However, human thought processes are often non-linear, rather than simply
sequential chains of thoughts. Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT)
reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as
a graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as
edges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and
allows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. GoT adopts a
two-stage framework with an additional GoT encoder for thought graph
representation and fuses the graph representation with the original input
representation through a gated fusion mechanism. We evaluate GoT's performance
on a text-only reasoning task (AQUA-RAT) and a multimodal reasoning task
(ScienceQA). Our model achieves significant improvement over the strong CoT
baseline on the AQUA-RAT test set and boosts accuracy from 85.19% to 87.59%
using the T5-base model over the state-of-the-art Multimodal-CoT on the
ScienceQA test set.

communication. However, many MT systems still struggle to translate sentences
containing cultural-specific entities accurately and understandably. Recent
advancements in in-context learning utilize lightweight prompts to guide large
language models (LLMs) in machine translation tasks. Nevertheless, the
effectiveness of this approach in enhancing machine translation with cultural
awareness remains uncertain. To address this gap, we introduce a new data
curation pipeline to construct a culturally relevant parallel corpus, enriched
with annotations of cultural-specific items. Furthermore, we devise a novel
evaluation metric to assess the understandability of translations in a
reference-free manner by GPT-4. We evaluate a variety of neural machine
translation (NMT) and LLM-based MT systems using our dataset. Additionally, we
propose several prompting strategies for LLMs to incorporate external and
internal cultural knowledge into the translation process. Our results
demonstrate that eliciting explanations can significantly enhance the
understandability of cultural-specific entities, especially those without
well-known translations.

                                        <span>  Existing neural response generation models have achieved impressive
improvements for two-party conversations, which assume that utterances are
sequentially organized. However, many real-world dialogues involve multiple
interlocutors and the structure of conversational context is much more complex,
e.g. utterances from different interlocutors can occur "in parallel". Facing
this challenge, there are works trying to model the relations among utterances
or interlocutors to facilitate response generation with clearer context.
Nonetheless, these methods rely heavily on such relations and all assume that
these are given beforehand, which is impractical and hinders the generality of
such methods. In this work, we propose to automatically infer the relations via
relational thinking on subtle clues inside the conversation context without any
human label, and leverage these relations to guide the neural response
generation. Specifically, we first apply a deep graph random process to fully
consider all possible relations among utterances in the conversational context.
Then the inferred relation graphs are integrated with a variational
auto-encoder framework to train a GAN for structure-aware response generation.
Experimental results on the Ubuntu Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel benchmark
and the most recent Movie Dialogues show that our method outperforms various
baseline models for multi-party response generation.

                                        <span>  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities
by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a
fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the
CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more
complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which
increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design
of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these
models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To
tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar
to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,
we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which
largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model
performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their
similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned
tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned
tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5,
our approach can compress the visual tokens by 14.4 times on average, and
achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and
reasoning tasks. Code and checkpoints are at https://llava-prumerge.github.io/.

can engage in exploration, a core capability in reinforcement learning and
decision making. We focus on native performance of existing LLMs, without
training interventions. We deploy LLMs as agents in simple multi-armed bandit
environments, specifying the environment description and interaction history
entirely in-context, i.e., within the LLM prompt. We experiment with GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, and Llama2, using a variety of prompt designs, and find that the models
do not robustly engage in exploration without substantial interventions: i)
Across all of our experiments, only one configuration resulted in satisfactory
exploratory behavior: GPT-4 with chain-of-thought reasoning and an externally
summarized interaction history, presented as sufficient statistics; ii) All
other configurations did not result in robust exploratory behavior, including
those with chain-of-thought reasoning but unsummarized history. Although these
findings can be interpreted positively, they suggest that external
summarization -- which may not be possible in more complex settings -- is
important for obtaining desirable behavior from LLM agents. We conclude that
non-trivial algorithmic interventions, such as fine-tuning or dataset curation,
may be required to empower LLM-based decision making agents in complex
settings.

                                        <span>  Watermark has been widely deployed by industry to detect AI-generated images.
The robustness of such watermark-based detector against evasion attacks in the
white-box and black-box settings is well understood in the literature. However,
the robustness in the no-box setting is much less understood. In particular,
multiple studies claimed that image watermark is robust in such setting. In
this work, we propose a new transfer evasion attack to image watermark in the
no-box setting. Our transfer attack adds a perturbation to a watermarked image
to evade multiple surrogate watermarking models trained by the attacker itself,
and the perturbed watermarked image also evades the target watermarking model.
Our major contribution is to show that, both theoretically and empirically,
watermark-based AI-generated image detector is not robust to evasion attacks
even if the attacker does not have access to the watermarking model nor the
detection API.

                                        <span>  This thesis investigates how natural language understanding and generation
with transformer models can benefit from grounding the models with knowledge
representations and addresses the following key research questions: (i) Can
knowledge of entities extend its benefits beyond entity-centric tasks, such as
entity linking? (ii) How can we faithfully and effectively extract such
structured knowledge from raw text, especially noisy web text? (iii) How do
other types of knowledge, beyond structured knowledge, contribute to improving
NLP tasks?
  Studies in this thesis find that incorporating relevant and up-to-date
knowledge of entities benefits fake news detection, and entity-focused
code-switching significantly enhances zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on
entity-centric tasks. In terms of effective and faithful approaches to
extracting structured knowledge, it is observed that integrating negative
examples and training with entity planning significantly improves performance.
Additionally, it is established that other general forms of knowledge, such as
parametric and distilled knowledge, enhance multimodal and multilingual
knowledge-intensive tasks. This research shows the tangible benefits of diverse
knowledge integration and motivates further exploration in this direction.

                                        <span>  Current language models are unable to quickly learn new concepts on the fly,
often requiring a more involved finetuning process to learn robustly. Prompting
in-context is not robust to context distractions, and often fails to confer
much information about the new concepts. Classic methods for few-shot word
learning in NLP, relying on global word vectors, are less applicable to large
language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named CoLLEGe
(Concept Learning with Language Embedding Generation) to modernize few-shot
concept learning. CoLLEGe is a meta-learning framework capable of generating
flexible embeddings for new concepts using a small number of example sentences
or definitions. Our primary meta-learning objective is simply to facilitate a
language model to make next word predictions in forthcoming sentences, making
it compatible with language model pretraining. We design a series of tasks to
test new concept learning in challenging real-world scenarios, including new
word acquisition, definition inference, and verbal reasoning, and demonstrate
that our method succeeds in each setting without task-specific training.

question-answering and summarization, necessitates both content selection and
content consolidation. Current end-to-end methods are difficult to control and
interpret due to their opaqueness. Accordingly, recent works have proposed a
modular approach, with separate components for each step. Specifically, we
focus on the second subtask, of generating coherent text given pre-selected
content in a multi-document setting. Concretely, we formalize
\textit{Fusion-in-Context} (FiC) as a standalone task, whose input consists of
source texts with highlighted spans of targeted content. A model then needs to
generate a coherent passage that includes all and only the target information.
Our work includes the development of a curated dataset of 1000 instances in the
reviews domain, alongside a novel evaluation framework for assessing the
faithfulness and coverage of highlights, which strongly correlate to human
judgment. Several baseline models exhibit promising outcomes and provide
insightful analyses. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of
modular text generation in the multi-document setting, offering potential
improvements in the quality and reliability of generated content. \footnote{Our

                                        <span>  In this work, we present a method to control a text-to-image generative model
to produce training data specifically "useful" for supervised learning. Unlike
previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to
generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop
an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The
first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds
adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model
loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the
model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be
inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides
the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the
method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform
our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different
types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to
open-loop approaches.

                                        <span>  Over the last two decades, a growing body of experimental research has
provided evidence that linguistic frames influence human behaviour in economic
games, beyond the economic consequences of the available actions. This article
proposes a novel framework that transcends the traditional confines of
outcome-based preference models. According to the LENS model, the Linguistic
description of the decision problem triggers Emotional responses and suggests
potential Norms of behaviour, which then interact to shape an individual's
Strategic choice. The article reviews experimental evidence that supports each
path of the LENS model. Furthermore, it identifies and discusses several
critical research questions that arise from this model, pointing towards
avenues for future inquiry.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Fundus, a user-friendly news scraper that enables users
to obtain millions of high-quality news articles with just a few lines of code.
Unlike existing news scrapers, we use manually crafted, bespoke content
extractors that are specifically tailored to the formatting guidelines of each
supported online newspaper. This allows us to optimize our scraping for quality
such that retrieved news articles are textually complete and without HTML
artifacts. Further, our framework combines both crawling (retrieving HTML from
the web or large web archives) and content extraction into a single pipeline.
By providing a unified interface for a predefined collection of newspapers, we
aim to make Fundus broadly usable even for non-technical users. This paper
gives an overview of the framework, discusses our design choices, and presents
a comparative evaluation against other popular news scrapers. Our evaluation
shows that Fundus yields significantly higher quality extractions (complete and
artifact-free news articles) than prior work. The framework is available on
GitHub under https://github.com/flairNLP/fundus and can be simply installed
using pip.

modeling of Noun Phrases' (NPs) genericity in natural language. The framework
is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it accessible to non-expert
annotators and suitable for crowd-sourced tasks. Drawing from theoretical and
cognitive literature on genericity, this framework is grounded in established
linguistic theory. Through a pilot study, we created a small but crucial
annotated dataset of 324 sentences, serving as a foundation for future
research. To validate our approach, we conducted an evaluation comparing our
continuous annotations with existing binary annotations on the same dataset,
demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in capturing nuanced aspects of
genericity. Our work offers a practical resource for linguists, providing a
first annotated dataset and an annotation scheme designed to build
real-language datasets that can be used in studies on the semantics of
genericity, and NLP practitioners, contributing to the development of
commonsense knowledge repositories valuable in enhancing various NLP
applications.

                                        <span>  Event temporal relation (TempRel) is a primary subject of the event relation
extraction task. However, the inherent ambiguity of TempRel increases the
difficulty of the task. With the rise of prompt engineering, it is important to
design effective prompt templates and verbalizers to extract relevant
knowledge. The traditional manually designed templates struggle to extract
precise temporal knowledge. This paper introduces a novel retrieval-augmented
TempRel extraction approach, leveraging knowledge retrieved from large language
models (LLMs) to enhance prompt templates and verbalizers. Our method
capitalizes on the diverse capabilities of various LLMs to generate a wide
array of ideas for template and verbalizer design. Our proposed method fully
exploits the potential of LLMs for generation tasks and contributes more
knowledge to our design. Empirical evaluations across three widely recognized
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method in improving the performance of
event temporal relation extraction tasks.

proposed to enhance the knowledge required for question answering over Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, the former depends on external resources, and
both require incorporating the explicit documents into the context, which
results in longer contexts that lead to more resource consumption. Recent works
indicate that LLMs have modeled rich knowledge, albeit not effectively
triggered or activated. Inspired by this, we propose a novel
knowledge-augmented framework, Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG), which
simulates the human capacity to compensate for knowledge deficits while
answering questions solely through imagination, without relying on external
resources. Guided by IAG, we propose an imagine richer context method for
question answering (IMcQA), which obtains richer context through the following
two modules: explicit imagination by generating a short dummy document with
long context compress and implicit imagination with HyperNetwork for generating
adapter weights. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that IMcQA
exhibits significant advantages in both open-domain and closed-book settings,
as well as in both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution
generalizations. Our code will be available at

comprehending and propelling these models forward is increasingly paramount.
Evaluations have revealed that factors such as scaling, training types,
architectures and other factors profoundly impact the performance of LLMs.
However, the extent and nature of these impacts continue to be subjects of
debate because most assessments have been restricted to a limited number of
models and data points. Clarifying the effects of these factors on performance
scores can be more effectively achieved through a statistical lens. Our study
embarks on a thorough re-examination of these LLMs, targeting the inadequacies
in current evaluation methods. With the advent of a uniform evaluation
framework, our research leverages an expansive dataset of evaluation results,
introducing a comprehensive statistical methodology. This includes the
application of ANOVA, Tukey HSD tests, GAMM, and clustering technique, offering
a robust and transparent approach to deciphering LLM performance data. Contrary
to prevailing findings, our results challenge assumptions about emergent
abilities and the influence of given training types and architectures in LLMs.
These findings furnish new perspectives on the characteristics, intrinsic
nature, and developmental trajectories of LLMs. By providing straightforward
and reliable methods to scrutinize and reassess LLM performance data, this
study contributes a nuanced perspective on LLM efficiency and potentials.

instructions that enable a diverse amount of user tasks. However, despite
Information Retrieval (IR) models using LLMs as the backbone of their
architectures, nearly all of them still only take queries as input, with no
instructions. For the handful of recent models that do take instructions, it's
unclear how they use them. We introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a
rigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping
IR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR builds off
the long history of the TREC conferences: as TREC provides human annotators
with instructions (also known as narratives) to determine document relevance,
so should IR models be able to understand and decide relevance based on these
detailed instructions. Our evaluation benchmark starts with three deeply judged
TREC collections and alters the annotator instructions, re-annotating relevant
documents. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow
instructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate
that existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them
for basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However,
we show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex
instructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements (over 13%)
after fine-tuning on our training set.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel parameter and computation efficient tuning
method for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), termed Efficient
Attention Skipping (EAS). Concretely, we first reveal that multi-head
attentions (MHAs), the main computational overhead of MLLMs, are often
redundant to downstream tasks. Based on this observation, EAS evaluates the
attention redundancy and skips the less important MHAs to speed up inference.
Besides, we also propose a novel propagation-of-information adapter (PIA) to
serve the attention skipping of EAS and keep parameter efficiency, which can be
further re-parameterized into feed-forward networks (FFNs) for zero-extra
latency. To validate EAS, we apply it to a recently proposed MLLM called LaVIN
and a classic VL pre-trained model called METER, and conduct extensive
experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experiments show that EAS not only
retains high performance and parameter efficiency, but also greatly speeds up
inference speed. For instance, LaVIN-EAS can obtain 89.98\% accuracy on
ScineceQA while speeding up inference by 2.2 times to LaVIN

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) raise concerns about lowering the cost of
generating texts that could be used for unethical or illegal purposes,
especially on social media. This paper investigates the promise of such models
to help enforce legal requirements related to the disclosure of sponsored
content online. We investigate the use of LLMs for generating synthetic
Instagram captions with two objectives: The first objective (fidelity) is to
produce realistic synthetic datasets. For this, we implement content-level and
network-level metrics to assess whether synthetic captions are realistic. The
second objective (utility) is to create synthetic data that is useful for
sponsored content detection. For this, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated synthetic data for training classifiers to identify undisclosed
advertisements on Instagram. Our investigations show that the objectives of
fidelity and utility may conflict and that prompt engineering is a useful but
insufficient strategy. Additionally, we find that while individual synthetic
posts may appear realistic, collectively they lack diversity, topic
connectivity, and realistic user interaction patterns.

                                        <span>  Language model-based code completion models have quickly grown in use,
helping thousands of developers write code in many different programming
languages. However, research on code completion models typically focuses on
imperative languages such as Python and JavaScript, which results in a lack of
representation for functional programming languages. Consequently, these models
often perform poorly on functional languages such as Haskell. To investigate
whether this can be alleviated, we evaluate the performance of two language
models for code, CodeGPT and UniXcoder, on the functional programming language
Haskell. We fine-tune and evaluate the models on Haskell functions sourced from
a publicly accessible Haskell dataset on HuggingFace. Additionally, we manually
evaluate the models using our novel translated HumanEval dataset. Our automatic
evaluation shows that knowledge of imperative programming languages in the
pre-training of LLMs may not transfer well to functional languages, but that
code completion on functional languages is feasible. Consequently, this shows
the need for more high-quality Haskell datasets. A manual evaluation on
HumanEval-Haskell indicates CodeGPT frequently generates empty predictions and
extra comments, while UniXcoder more often produces incomplete or incorrect
predictions. Finally, we release HumanEval-Haskell, along with the fine-tuned
models and all code required to reproduce our experiments on GitHub
(https://github.com/AISE-TUDelft/HaskellCCEval).

and how to conveniently expand the application scenario of AI agents has become
a challenge. Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning
capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more
complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this
paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using
an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set
of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the
dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the
planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents. Utilizing the proposed
system, we present a demo to illustrate the operation and the application
scenario extension of CACA Agent.

the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more
conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the
social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity,
quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing
effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the
first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then
argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and
engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of
one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are
necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. The
proposed maxims offer prescriptive guidance on how to assess conversational
quality between humans and LLM-driven conversational agents, informing both
their evaluation and improved design.

digital content, helping to structure and find hidden patterns in uncategorised
data. In this research, we investigated how different textual embeddings -
particularly those used in large language models (LLMs) - and clustering
algorithms affect how text datasets are clustered. A series of experiments were
conducted to assess how embeddings influence clustering results, the role
played by dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and embedding size
adjustment. Results reveal that LLM embeddings excel at capturing the nuances
of structured language, while BERT leads the lightweight options in
performance. In addition, we find that increasing embedding dimensionality and
summarisation techniques do not uniformly improve clustering efficiency,
suggesting that these strategies require careful analysis to use in real-life
models. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for nuanced
text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering
applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by
incorporating embeddings from LLMs, thereby paving the way for improved
methodologies and opening new avenues for future research in various types of
textual analysis.

associated arguments. Moreover, the information-rich nature of events leads to
the scarcity of event KBs. This emphasizes the need for event linking models to
identify and classify event mentions not in the KB as ``out-of-KB,'' an area
that has received limited attention. In this work, we tackle these challenges
by introducing an argument-aware approach. First, we improve event linking
models by augmenting input text with tagged event argument information,
facilitating the recognition of key information about event mentions.
Subsequently, to help the model handle ``out-of-KB'' scenarios, we synthesize
out-of-KB training examples from in-KB instances through controlled
manipulation of event arguments. Our experiment across two test datasets showed
significant enhancements in both in-KB and out-of-KB scenarios, with a notable
22% improvement in out-of-KB evaluations.

Digital Humanities (DH) and serves as the cornerstone for advancing the
structural analysis of historical and cultural heritage texts. This is
particularly true for the domains of named entity recognition (NER) and
relation extraction (RE). In our commitment to expediting ancient history and
culture, we present the ``Chinese Historical Information Extraction
Corpus''(CHisIEC). CHisIEC is a meticulously curated dataset designed to
develop and evaluate NER and RE tasks, offering a resource to facilitate
research in the field. Spanning a remarkable historical timeline encompassing
data from 13 dynasties spanning over 1830 years, CHisIEC epitomizes the
extensive temporal range and text heterogeneity inherent in Chinese historical
documents. The dataset encompasses four distinct entity types and twelve
relation types, resulting in a meticulously labeled dataset comprising 14,194
entities and 8,609 relations. To establish the robustness and versatility of
our dataset, we have undertaken comprehensive experimentation involving models
of various sizes and paradigms. Additionally, we have evaluated the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of tasks related to
ancient Chinese history. The dataset and code are available at

                                        <span>  Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are currently state-of-the-art for
solving the vast majority of natural language processing tasks. While many
real-world applications still require fine-tuning to reach satisfactory levels
of performance, many of them are in the low-data regime, making fine-tuning
challenging. To address this, we propose LLM2LLM, a targeted and iterative data
augmentation strategy that uses a teacher LLM to enhance a small seed dataset
by augmenting additional data that can be used for fine-tuning on a specific
task. LLM2LLM (1) fine-tunes a baseline student LLM on the initial seed data,
(2) evaluates and extracts data points that the model gets wrong, and (3) uses
a teacher LLM to generate synthetic data based on these incorrect data points,
which are then added back into the training data. This approach amplifies the
signal from incorrectly predicted data points by the LLM during training and
reintegrates them into the dataset to focus on more challenging examples for
the LLM. Our results show that LLM2LLM significantly enhances the performance
of LLMs in the low-data regime, outperforming both traditional fine-tuning and
other data augmentation baselines. LLM2LLM reduces the dependence on
labor-intensive data curation and paves the way for more scalable and
performant LLM solutions, allowing us to tackle data-constrained domains and
tasks. We achieve improvements up to 24.2% on the GSM8K dataset, 32.6% on
CaseHOLD, 32.0% on SNIPS, 52.6% on TREC and 39.8% on SST-2 over regular
fine-tuning in the low-data regime using a LLaMA2-7B student model.

higher investment return indicators. Accordingly, ongoing efforts are being
made to automate ESG evaluation with language models to extract signals from
massive web text easily. However, recent approaches suffer from a lack of
training data, as rating agencies keep their evaluation metrics confidential.
This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 can
be guided to align with unknown ESG evaluation criteria through strategies such
as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic in-context learning. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches by ranking 2nd in the Shared-Task
ML-ESG-3 Impact Type track for Korean without updating the model on the
provided training data. We also explore how adjusting prompts impacts the
ability of language models to address financial tasks leveraging smaller models
with openly available weights. We observe longer general pre-training to
correlate with enhanced performance in financial downstream tasks. Our findings
showcase the potential of language models to navigate complex, subjective
evaluation guidelines despite lacking explicit training examples, revealing
opportunities for training-free solutions for financial downstream tasks.

Models (LLMs) as they become increasingly prevalent in various applications.
Focusing on how reward models, which are designed to fine-tune pretrained LLMs
to align with human values, perceive and categorize different types of risks,
we delve into the challenges posed by the subjective nature of preference-based
training data. By utilizing the Anthropic Red-team dataset, we analyze major
risk categories, including Information Hazards, Malicious Uses, and
Discrimination/Hateful content. Our findings indicate that LLMs tend to
consider Information Hazards less harmful, a finding confirmed by a specially
developed regression model. Additionally, our analysis shows that LLMs respond
less stringently to Information Hazards compared to other risks. The study
further reveals a significant vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks in
Information Hazard scenarios, highlighting a critical security concern in LLM
risk assessment and emphasizing the need for improved AI safety measures.

which provides a dataset of puzzles for testing natural language understanding.
We employ large language models (LLMs) to solve this task through several
prompting techniques. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting generate reasonably good
results when tested with proprietary LLMs, compared to the open-source models.
We obtain further improved results with chain-of-thought prompting, an
iterative prompting method that breaks down the reasoning process step-by-step.
We obtain our best results by utilizing an ensemble of chain-of-thought
prompts, placing 2nd in the word puzzle subtask and 13th in the sentence puzzle
subtask. The strong performance of prompted LLMs demonstrates their capability
for complex reasoning when provided with a decomposition of the thought
process. Our work sheds light on how step-wise explanatory prompts can unlock
more of the knowledge encoded in the parameters of large models.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate
into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the
trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the
diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These
challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating
schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating
approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are
confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through
world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the
graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts.
Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in
Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.

Adam encounter significant memory consumption challenges due to the storage of
first and second moment data. Current memory-efficient methods like Adafactor
and CAME often compromise accuracy with their matrix factorization techniques.
Addressing this, we introduce Adapprox, a novel approach that employs
randomized low-rank matrix approximation for a more effective and accurate
approximation of Adam's second moment. Adapprox features an adaptive rank
selection mechanism, finely balancing accuracy and memory efficiency, and
includes an optional cosine similarity guidance strategy to enhance stability
and expedite convergence. In GPT-2 training and downstream tasks, Adapprox
surpasses AdamW by achieving 34.5% to 49.9% and 33.8% to 49.9% memory savings
for the 117M and 345M models, respectively, with the first moment enabled, and
further increases these savings without the first moment. Besides, it enhances
convergence speed and improves downstream task performance relative to its
counterparts.

                                        <span>  The proliferation of online misinformation has posed significant threats to
public interest. While numerous online users actively participate in the combat
against misinformation, many of such responses can be characterized by the lack
of politeness and supporting facts. As a solution, text generation approaches
are proposed to automatically produce counter-misinformation responses.
Nevertheless, existing methods are often trained end-to-end without leveraging
external knowledge, resulting in subpar text quality and excessively repetitive
responses. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented response generation
for online misinformation (RARG), which collects supporting evidence from
scientific sources and generates counter-misinformation responses based on the
evidences. In particular, our RARG consists of two stages: (1) evidence
collection, where we design a retrieval pipeline to retrieve and rerank
evidence documents using a database comprising over 1M academic articles; (2)
response generation, in which we align large language models (LLMs) to generate
evidence-based responses via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
We propose a reward function to maximize the utilization of the retrieved
evidence while maintaining the quality of the generated text, which yields
polite and factual responses that clearly refutes misinformation. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we study the case of COVID-19 and
perform extensive experiments with both in- and cross-domain datasets, where
RARG consistently outperforms baselines by generating high-quality
counter-misinformation responses.

knowledge graph embeddings to improve the effectiveness of PEFT. We propose a

\modelname can help activate the relevant parameterized knowledge in an LLM to
answer a question without changing its parameters or input prompts.

                                        <span>  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) method that updates an initial weight matrix $W_0$ with a delta matrix
$\Delta W$ consisted by two low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$. A previous study
suggested that there is correlation between $W_0$ and $\Delta W$. In this
study, we aim to delve deeper into relationships between $W_0$ and low-rank
matrices $A$ and $B$ to further comprehend the behavior of LoRA. In particular,
we analyze a conversion matrix that transform $W_0$ into low-rank matrices,
which encapsulates information about the relationships. Our analysis reveals
that the conversion matrices are similar across each layer. Inspired by these
findings, we hypothesize that a single linear layer, which takes each layer's
$W_0$ as input, can yield task-adapted low-rank matrices. To confirm this
hypothesis, we devise a method named Conditionally Parameterized LoRA
(CondLoRA) that updates initial weight matrices with low-rank matrices derived
from a single linear layer. Our empirical results show that CondLoRA maintains
a performance on par with LoRA, despite the fact that the trainable parameters
of CondLoRA are fewer than those of LoRA. Therefore, we conclude that "a single
linear layer yields task-adapted low-rank matrices."

models in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications is increasing
extensively. Counterspeech generation is one such key task where efforts are
made to develop generative models by fine-tuning LLMs with hatespeech -
counterspeech pairs, but none of these attempts explores the intrinsic
properties of large language models in zero-shot settings. In this work, we
present a comprehensive analysis of the performances of four LLMs namely GPT-2,
DialoGPT, ChatGPT and FlanT5 in zero-shot settings for counterspeech
generation, which is the first of its kind. For GPT-2 and DialoGPT, we further
investigate the deviation in performance with respect to the sizes (small,
medium, large) of the models. On the other hand, we propose three different
prompting strategies for generating different types of counterspeech and
analyse the impact of such strategies on the performance of the models. Our
analysis shows that there is an improvement in generation quality for two
datasets (17%), however the toxicity increase (25%) with increase in model
size. Considering type of model, GPT-2 and FlanT5 models are significantly
better in terms of counterspeech quality but also have high toxicity as
compared to DialoGPT. ChatGPT are much better at generating counter speech than
other models across all metrics. In terms of prompting, we find that our
proposed strategies help in improving counter speech generation across all the
models.

generation tasks with pre-trained language models, while early-exiting is an
effective approach to speedup the inference stage. In this work, we propose a
novel decoding strategy named Hierarchical Skip Decoding (HSD) for efficient
autoregressive text generation. Different from existing methods that require
additional trainable components, HSD is a plug-and-play method applicable to
autoregressive text generation models, it adaptively skips decoding layers in a
hierarchical manner based on the current sequence length, thereby reducing
computational workload and allocating computation resources. Comprehensive
experiments on five text generation datasets with pre-trained language models
demonstrate HSD's advantages in balancing efficiency and text quality. With
almost half of the layers skipped, HSD can sustain 90% of the text quality
compared to vanilla autoregressive decoding, outperforming the competitive
approaches.

general reasoning strategies that can be employed for new topics. We present
Stance Reasoner, an approach to zero-shot stance detection on social media that
leverages explicit reasoning over background knowledge to guide the model's
inference about the document's stance on a target. Specifically, our method
uses a pre-trained language model as a source of world knowledge, with the

important. The most widely adopted technique to accomplish this is DP-SGD,
which trains a model in such a way that guarantees Differential Privacy (DP).
However, DP-SGD requires longer training times and larger memory requirements
than SGD, while overestimating an adversary's capabilities in having white box
access to the model. A more realistic scenario assumes only black-box access to
a privacy-sensitive LLM. Motivated by these observations, we present Private
Mixing of Ensemble Distributions (PMixED): a private prediction protocol that
achieves practical next-token prediction by projecting each of the model's
output distribution from an ensemble of fine-tuned LLMs onto a set around a
public LLM's output distribution, then averaging the projected distributions
and sampling from it. Our approach is more lightweight than DP-SGD in that it
is model agnostic, instead providing differential privacy at prediction rather
than during training. Our results show that PMixED achieves a stronger privacy
guarantee than sample-level privacy and outperforms DP-SGD for privacy
$\epsilon = 8$ on large-scale datasets.

only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving
significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift
induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data
or poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and
scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and
replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully
re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by final loss and
language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we show this for a
weak but realistic distribution shift between two commonly used LLM
pre-training datasets (English$\rightarrow$English) and a stronger distribution
shift (English$\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M parameter model scale with
large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of tokens). Selecting the weak but
realistic shift for larger-scale experiments, we also find that our continual
learning strategies match the re-training baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our
results demonstrate that LLMs can be successfully updated via simple and
scalable continual learning strategies, matching the re-training baseline using
only a fraction of the compute. Finally, inspired by previous work, we propose
alternatives to the cosine learning rate schedule that help circumvent
forgetting induced by LR re-warming and that are not bound to a fixed token
budget.

                                        <span>  Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the mainstream choice for
fewshot and zeroshot learning thanks to the universality of text generation.
Many users, however, do not need the broad capabilities of generative LLMs when
they only want to automate a classification task. Smaller BERT-like models can
also learn universal tasks, which allow them to do any text classification task
without requiring fine-tuning (zeroshot classification) or to learn new tasks
with only a few examples (fewshot), while being significantly more efficient
than generative LLMs. This paper (1) explains how Natural Language Inference
(NLI) can be used as a universal classification task that follows similar
principles as instruction fine-tuning of generative LLMs, (2) provides a
step-by-step guide with reusable Jupyter notebooks for building a universal
classifier, and (3) shares the resulting universal classifier that is trained
on 33 datasets with 389 diverse classes. Parts of the code we share has been
used to train our older zeroshot classifiers that have been downloaded more
than 55 million times via the Hugging Face Hub as of December 2023. Our new
classifier improves zeroshot performance by 9.4%.

                                        <span>  In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture
components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the
image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data
choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we
demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of
image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,
compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the
image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has
substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of
comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we
build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both
dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in
pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised
fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to
large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced
in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting.

of syntactic dependency distance minimization is in conflict with the principle
of surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) in single head
syntactic dependency structures: while the former predicts that the head should
be placed at the center of the linear arrangement, the latter predicts that the
head should be placed at one of the ends (either first or last). A critical
question is when surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) should
surpass syntactic dependency distance minimization. In the context of single
head structures, it has been predicted that this is more likely to happen when
two conditions are met, i.e. (a) fewer words are involved and (b) words are
shorter. Here we test the prediction on the noun phrase when it is composed of
a demonstrative, a numeral, an adjective and a noun. We find that, across
preferred orders in languages, the noun tends to be placed at one of the ends,
confirming the theoretical prediction. We also show evidence of anti locality
effects: syntactic dependency distances in preferred orders are longer than
expected by chance.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce an improved approach of speculative decoding
aimed at enhancing the efficiency of serving large language models. Our method
capitalizes on the strengths of two established techniques: the classic
two-model speculative decoding approach, and the more recent single-model
approach, Medusa. Drawing inspiration from Medusa, our approach adopts a
single-model strategy for speculative decoding. However, our method
distinguishes itself by employing a single, lightweight draft head with a
recurrent dependency design, akin in essence to the small, draft model uses in
classic speculative decoding, but without the complexities of the full
transformer architecture. And because of the recurrent dependency, we can use
beam search to swiftly filter out undesired candidates with the draft head. The
outcome is a method that combines the simplicity of single-model design and
avoids the need to create a data-dependent tree attention structure only for
inference in Medusa. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on several popular open source language models, along with a
comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs involved in adopting this approach.

                                        <span>  Heart failure (HF) poses a significant public health challenge, with a rising
global mortality rate. Early detection and prevention of HF could significantly
reduce its impact. We introduce a novel methodology for predicting HF risk
using 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We present a novel, lightweight
dual-attention ECG network designed to capture complex ECG features essential
for early HF risk prediction, despite the notable imbalance between low and
high-risk groups. This network incorporates a cross-lead attention module and
twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules, focusing on cross-lead
interactions and each lead's local dynamics. To further alleviate model
overfitting, we leverage a large language model (LLM) with a public ECG-Report
dataset for pretraining on an ECG-report alignment task. The network is then
fine-tuned for HF risk prediction using two specific cohorts from the UK
Biobank study, focusing on patients with hypertension (UKB-HYP) and those who
have had a myocardial infarction (UKB-MI).The results reveal that LLM-informed
pre-training substantially enhances HF risk prediction in these cohorts. The
dual-attention design not only improves interpretability but also predictive
accuracy, outperforming existing competitive methods with C-index scores of
0.6349 for UKB-HYP and 0.5805 for UKB-MI. This demonstrates our method's
potential in advancing HF risk assessment with clinical complex ECG data.

concerns regarding its impact on public opinion. While misinformation is
prevalent in other languages, the majority of research in this field has
concentrated on the English language. Hence, there is a scarcity of datasets
for other languages, including Turkish. To address this concern, we have
introduced the FCTR dataset, consisting of 3238 real-world claims. This dataset
spans multiple domains and incorporates evidence collected from three Turkish
fact-checking organizations. Additionally, we aim to assess the effectiveness
of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource languages, with a
particular focus on Turkish. We demonstrate in-context learning (zero-shot and
few-shot) performance of large language models in this context. The
experimental results indicate that the dataset has the potential to advance
research in the Turkish language.

                                        <span>  The Random Language Model (De Giuli 2019) is an ensemble of stochastic
context-free grammars, quantifying the syntax of human and computer languages.
The model suggests a simple picture of first language learning as a type of
annealing in the vast space of potential languages. In its simplest
formulation, it implies a single continuous transition to grammatical syntax,
at which the symmetry among potential words and categories is spontaneously
broken. Here this picture is scrutinized by considering its robustness against
extensions of the original model, and trajectories through parameter space
different from those originally considered. It is shown here that (i) the
scenario is robust to explicit symmetry breaking, an inevitable component of
learning in the real world; and (ii) the transition to grammatical syntax can
be encountered by fixing the deep (hidden) structure while varying the surface
(observable) properties. It is also argued that the transition becomes a sharp
thermodynamic transition in an idealized limit. Moreover, comparison with human
data on the clustering coefficient of syntax networks suggests that the
observed transition is equivalent to that normally experienced by children at
age 24 months. The results are discussed in light of theory of first-language
acquisition in linguistics, and recent successes in machine learning.

within the images. Computer vision models involving the multimodal abilities in
the previous days are focused on image detection, classification based on
well-defined objects. Large language models (LLMs) introduces the
transformation from nature language to visual objects, which present the visual
layout for text contexts. OpenAI GPT-4 has emerged as the pinnacle in LLMs,
while the computer vision (CV) domain boasts a plethora of state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models and algorithms to convert 2D images to their 3D representations.
However, the mismatching between the algorithms with the problem could lead to
undesired results. In response to this challenge, we propose an unified
VisionGPT-3D framework to consolidate the state-of-the-art vision models,
thereby facilitating the development of vision-oriented AI. VisionGPT-3D
provides a versatile multimodal framework building upon the strengths of
multimodal foundation models. It seamlessly integrates various SOTA vision
models and brings the automation in the selection of SOTA vision models,
identifies the suitable 3D mesh creation algorithms corresponding to 2D depth
maps analysis, generates optimal results based on diverse multimodal inputs
such as text prompts.

simply a response to visual stimuli; rather, it hinges on the human capacity to
understand (and appreciate) commonsense violations depicted in these videos. We
introduce FunQA, a challenging video question-answering (QA) dataset
specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the depth of video reasoning
based on counter-intuitive and fun videos. Unlike most video QA benchmarks
which focus on less surprising contexts, e.g., cooking or instructional videos,
FunQA covers three previously unexplored types of surprising videos: 1)
HumorQA, 2) CreativeQA, and 3) MagicQA. For each subset, we establish rigorous
QA tasks designed to assess the model's capability in counter-intuitive
timestamp localization, detailed video description, and reasoning around
counter-intuitiveness. We also pose higher-level tasks, such as attributing a
fitting and vivid title to the video and scoring the video creativity. In
total, the FunQA benchmark consists of 312K free-text QA pairs derived from
4.3K video clips, spanning a total of 24 video hours. Moreover, we propose
FunMentor, an agent designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that uses
multi-turn dialogues to enhance models' understanding of counter-intuitiveness.
Extensive experiments with existing VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of
FunMentor and reveal significant performance gaps for the FunQA videos across
spatial-temporal reasoning, visual-centered reasoning, and free-text
generation.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in following user
instructions and generating helpful responses. Nevertheless, their robustness
is still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent
responses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions. Recent
literature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance
of continued improvement in the robustness of response generation. However,
systematic analysis and solutions are still lacking. In this paper, we
quantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage
training framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning
and consistency alignment training. The first stage helps a model generalize on
following instructions via similar instruction augmentations. In the second
stage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses
are more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences
in similar responses. The training process is accomplished by self-rewards
inferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to
external human preference resources. We conduct extensive experiments on recent
publicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our training framework.

                                        <span>  The jailbreak attack can bypass the safety measures of a Large Language Model
(LLM), generating harmful content. This misuse of LLM has led to negative
societal consequences. Currently, there are two main approaches to address
jailbreak attacks: safety training and safeguards. Safety training focuses on
further training LLM to enhance its safety. On the other hand, safeguards
involve implementing external models or filters to prevent harmful outputs.
However, safety training has constraints in its ability to adapt to new attack
types and often leads to a drop in model performance. Safeguards have proven to
be of limited help. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach called
Self-Guard, which combines the strengths of both safety methods. Self-Guard
includes two stages. In the first stage, we enhance the model's ability to
assess harmful content, and in the second stage, we instruct the model to
consistently perform harmful content detection on its own responses. The
experiment has demonstrated that Self-Guard is robust against jailbreak
attacks. In the bad case analysis, we find that LLM occasionally provides
harmless responses to harmful queries. Additionally, we evaluated the general
capabilities of the LLM before and after safety training, providing evidence
that Self-Guard does not result in the LLM's performance degradation. In
sensitivity tests, Self-Guard not only avoids inducing over-sensitivity in LLM
but also can even mitigate this issue.

Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI because of their unaffordable training
process and large computational demands. For the first time, we introduce the
information entropy of hidden state features into a pruning metric design,
namely E-Sparse, to improve the accuracy of N:M sparsity on LLM. E-Sparse
employs the information richness to leverage the channel importance, and
further incorporates several novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it
introduces information entropy to enhance the significance of parameter weights
and input feature norms as a novel pruning metric, and performs N:M sparsity
without modifying the remaining weights. (2) it designs global naive shuffle
and local block shuffle to quickly optimize the information distribution and
adequately cope with the impact of N:M sparsity on LLMs' accuracy. E-Sparse is
implemented as a Sparse-GEMM on FasterTransformer and runs on NVIDIA Ampere
GPUs. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA family and OPT models show that
E-Sparse can significantly speed up the model inference over the dense model
(up to 1.53X) and obtain significant memory saving (up to 43.52%), with
acceptable accuracy loss.

performance of Neural Machine Translation. Knowledge Distillation (KD) enhances
efficiency by transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a more compact
student model. However, KD approaches to Transformer architecture often rely on
heuristics, particularly when deciding which teacher layers to distill from. In
this paper, we introduce the 'Align-to-Distill' (A2D) strategy, designed to
address the feature mapping problem by adaptively aligning student attention
heads with their teacher counterparts during training. The Attention Alignment
Module in A2D performs a dense head-by-head comparison between student and
teacher attention heads across layers, turning the combinatorial mapping
heuristics into a learning problem. Our experiments show the efficacy of A2D,
demonstrating gains of up to +3.61 and +0.63 BLEU points for WMT-2022 De->Dsb
and WMT-2014 En->De, respectively, compared to Transformer baselines.

significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant
LLMs serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention
can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have
shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention,
a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes
across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime
to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking
monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the
auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache,
we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition
algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention
computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that
ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$
compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system
prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

                                        <span>  Event Causality Identification (ECI) refers to the detection of causal
relations between events in texts. However, most existing studies focus on
sentence-level ECI with high-resource languages, leaving more challenging
document-level ECI (DECI) with low-resource languages under-explored. In this
paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Interaction Model with
Multi-granularity Contrastive Transfer Learning (GIMC) for zero-shot
cross-lingual document-level ECI. Specifically, we introduce a heterogeneous
graph interaction network to model the long-distance dependencies between
events that are scattered over a document. Then, to improve cross-lingual
transferability of causal knowledge learned from the source language, we
propose a multi-granularity contrastive transfer learning module to align the
causal representations across languages. Extensive experiments show our
framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 9.4% and 8.2% of
average F1 score on monolingual and multilingual scenarios respectively.
Notably, in the multilingual scenario, our zero-shot framework even exceeds
GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning by 24.3% in overall performance.

adeptly handling the crucial task of cognitive reframing and overcoming
challenges such as shame, distrust, therapist skill variability, and resource
scarcity. Previous LLMs in cognitive reframing mainly converted negative
emotions to positive ones, but these approaches have limited efficacy, often
not promoting clients' self-discovery of alternative perspectives. In this
paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental
Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method
effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational,
balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs
empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically
guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings,
brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable
suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted
psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess
the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and
real-world therapeutic conversations. Experimental results show that our model
outperforms others in terms of empathy, guidance, and logical coherence,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential positive impact on psychotherapy.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot abilities
on a variety of open-ended tasks, while recent research has also explored the
use of LLMs for multi-modal generation. In this study, we introduce mPLUG-Owl,
a novel training paradigm that equips LLMs with multi-modal abilities through
modularized learning of foundation LLM, a visual knowledge module, and a visual
abstractor module. This approach can support multiple modalities and facilitate
diverse unimodal and multimodal abilities through modality collaboration. The
training paradigm of mPLUG-Owl involves a two-stage method for aligning image
and text, which learns visual knowledge with the assistance of LLM while
maintaining and even improving the generation abilities of LLM. In the first
stage, the visual knowledge module and abstractor module are trained with a
frozen LLM module to align the image and text. In the second stage,
language-only and multi-modal supervised datasets are used to jointly fine-tune
a low-rank adaption (LoRA) module on LLM and the abstractor module by freezing
the visual knowledge module. We carefully build a visually-related instruction
evaluation set OwlEval. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing multi-modal models, demonstrating mPLUG-Owl's impressive instruction
and visual understanding ability, multi-turn conversation ability, and
knowledge reasoning ability. Besides, we observe some unexpected and exciting
abilities such as multi-image correlation and scene text understanding, which
makes it possible to leverage it for harder real scenarios, such as vision-only
document comprehension. Our code, pre-trained model, instruction-tuned models,
and evaluation set are available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-Owl. The

Existing methods rely heavily on annotated data, making it challenging to apply
in low-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel LS method without
parallel corpora. This method employs an Adversarial Editing System with
guidance from a confusion loss and an invariance loss to predict lexical edits
in the original sentences. Meanwhile, we introduce an innovative LLM-enhanced
loss to enable the distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs)
into a small-size LS system. From that, complex words within sentences are
masked and a Difficulty-aware Filling module is crafted to replace masked
positions with simpler words. At last, extensive experimental results and
analyses on three benchmark LS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

                                        <span>  Sarcasm is a way of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they
mean, often to ridicule a person, situation, or idea. It is often difficult to
detect sarcasm in the dialogue since detecting sarcasm should reflect the
context (i.e., dialogue history). In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for
the Korean dialogue sarcasm detection task, KoCoSa (Korean Context-aware
Sarcasm Detection Dataset), which consists of 12.8K daily Korean dialogues and
the labels for this task on the last response. To build the dataset, we propose
an efficient sarcasm detection dataset generation pipeline: 1) generating new
sarcastic dialogues from source dialogues with large language models, 2)
automatic and manual filtering of abnormal and toxic dialogues, and 3) human
annotation for the sarcasm detection task. We also provide a simple but
effective baseline for the Korean sarcasm detection task trained on our
dataset. Experimental results on the dataset show that our baseline system
outperforms strong baselines like large language models, such as GPT-3.5, in
the Korean sarcasm detection task. We show that the sarcasm detection task
relies deeply on the existence of sufficient context. We will release the
dataset at https://github.com/Yu-billie/KoCoSa_sarcasm_detection.

various reasoning tasks. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT
are prone to logical errors during their reasoning processes. Existing
solutions, such as deploying task-specific verifiers or voting over multiple
reasoning paths, either require extensive human annotations or fail in
scenarios with inconsistent responses. To address these challenges, we
introduce RankPrompt, a new prompting method that enables LLMs to self-rank
their responses without additional resources. RankPrompt breaks down the
ranking problem into a series of comparisons among diverse responses,
leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs to generate chains of comparison
as contextual exemplars. Our experiments across 11 arithmetic and commonsense
reasoning tasks show that RankPrompt significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4, with improvements of up to 13%. Moreover,
RankPrompt excels in LLM-based automatic evaluations for open-ended tasks,
aligning with human judgments 74% of the time in the AlpacaEval dataset. It
also exhibits robustness to variations in response order and consistency.
Collectively, our results validate RankPrompt as an effective method for
eliciting high-quality feedback from language models.

and sequential recommendation has enjoyed considerable prevalence due to its
capacity to encapsulate the dynamic shifts in user interests. However, previous
sequential modeling methods still have limitations in capturing contextual
information. The primary reason is the lack of understanding of domain-specific
knowledge and item-related textual content by language models. Fortunately, the
emergence of powerful language models has unlocked the potential to incorporate
extensive world knowledge into recommendation algorithms, enabling them to go
beyond simple item attributes and truly understand the world surrounding user
preferences. To achieve this, we propose LANCER, which leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models to generate
personalized recommendations. Our approach bridges the gap between language
models and recommender systems, resulting in more human-like recommendations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of
experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, showing promising results
and providing valuable insights into the influence of our model on sequential
recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our experimental codes are publicly
available.

expensive to retrain or update frequently. As they are increasingly adopted for
knowledge-intensive tasks, it becomes evident that these design choices lead to
failures to generate factual, relevant, and up-to-date knowledge. To this end,
we propose Knowledge Card, a modular framework to plug in new factual and
relevant knowledge into general-purpose LLMs. We first introduce knowledge
cards -- specialized language models trained on corpora from specific domains
and sources. Knowledge cards serve as parametric repositories that are selected
at inference time to generate background knowledge for the base LLM. We then
propose three content selectors to dynamically select and retain information in
documents generated by knowledge cards, specifically controlling for relevance,
brevity, and factuality of outputs. Finally, we propose two complementary
integration approaches to augment the base LLM with the (relevant, factual)
knowledge curated from the specialized LMs. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that Knowledge Card achieves state-of-the-art performance on six
benchmark datasets. Ultimately, Knowledge Card framework enables dynamic
synthesis and updates of knowledge from diverse domains. Its modularity will
ensure that relevant knowledge can be continuously updated through the
collective efforts of the research community.

of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation. However, the success is
typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building
a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the
low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale,
high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective
training paradigm for training large multimodal models in non-English
languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot
zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong
multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only
image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a (quasi)-zero-shot
manner, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages.
Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in
image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art
(open-source) performance in Chinese. To facilitate future research, we

when deployed in new target environments. When obtaining labeled data from the
target distribution is expensive, few-shot adaptation with only a few examples
from the target distribution becomes essential. In this work, we propose
MixPro, a lightweight and highly data-efficient approach for few-shot
adaptation. MixPro first generates a relatively large dataset by mixing
(linearly combining) pre-trained embeddings of large source data with those of
the few target examples. This process preserves important features of both
source and target distributions, while mitigating the specific noise in the
small target data. Then, it trains a linear classifier on the mixed embeddings
to effectively adapts the model to the target distribution without overfitting
the small target data. Theoretically, we demonstrate the advantages of MixPro
over previous methods. Our experiments, conducted across various model
architectures on 8 datasets featuring different types of distribution shifts,
reveal that MixPro can outperform baselines by up to 7\%, with only 2-4 target
examples.

simulating human-like behavior, raising the question of their ability to
represent a diverse population of users. We introduce a new protocol to measure
the degree to which language models can accurately emulate human behavior in
conversational recommendation. This protocol is comprised of five tasks, each
designed to evaluate a key property that a synthetic user should exhibit:
choosing which items to talk about, expressing binary preferences, expressing
open-ended preferences, requesting recommendations, and giving feedback.
Through evaluation of baseline simulators, we demonstrate these tasks
effectively reveal deviations of language models from human behavior, and offer
insights on how to reduce the deviations with model selection and prompting
strategies.

diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly
focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge,
and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in
assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,
the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of
role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of
social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and
covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and
30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations
on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find
that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in
group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the
influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on
RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social
interaction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly

framework to create a dataset of NL-TL pairs combining LLMs and human
annotation. We publish a dataset with 28K NL-TL pairs. Then, we finetune T5
models on the lifted versions (i.e., the specific Atomic Propositions (AP) are
hidden) of the NL and TL. The enhanced generalizability originates from two
aspects: 1) Usage of lifted NL-TL characterizes common logical structures,
without constraints of specific domains. 2) Application of LLMs in dataset
creation largely enhances corpus richness. We test the generalization of
trained models on five varied domains. To achieve full NL-TL transformation, we
either combine the lifted model with AP recognition task or do the further
finetuning on each specific domain. During the further finetuning, our model
achieves higher accuracy (>95%) using only <10% training data, compared with
the baseline sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model.

                                        <span>  For effective human-robot interaction, robots need to understand, plan, and
execute complex, long-horizon tasks described by natural language. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for translating
natural language into robot action sequences for complex tasks. However,
existing approaches either translate the natural language directly into robot
trajectories or factor the inference process by decomposing language into task
sub-goals and relying on a motion planner to execute each sub-goal. When
complex environmental and temporal constraints are involved, inference over
planning tasks must be performed jointly with motion plans using traditional
task-and-motion planning (TAMP) algorithms, making factorization into subgoals
untenable. Rather than using LLMs to directly plan task sub-goals, we instead
perform few-shot translation from natural language task descriptions to an
intermediate task representation that can then be consumed by a TAMP algorithm
to jointly solve the task and motion plan. To improve translation, we
automatically detect and correct both syntactic and semantic errors via
autoregressive re-prompting, resulting in significant improvements in task
completion. We show that our approach outperforms several methods using LLMs as
planners in complex task domains. See our project website
https://yongchao98.github.io/MIT-REALM-AutoTAMP/ for prompts, videos, and code.

                                        <span>  Autoregressive models for text sometimes generate repetitive and low-quality
output because errors accumulate during the steps of generation. This issue is
often attributed to exposure bias - the difference between how a model is
trained, and how it is used during inference. Denoising diffusion models
provide an alternative approach in which a model can revisit and revise its
output. However, they can be computationally expensive and prior efforts on
text have led to models that produce less fluent output compared to
autoregressive models, especially for longer text and paragraphs. In this
paper, we propose PLANNER, a model that combines latent semantic diffusion with
autoregressive generation, to generate fluent text while exercising global
control over paragraphs. The model achieves this by combining an autoregressive
"decoding" module with a "planning" module that uses latent diffusion to
generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed
method is evaluated on various conditional generation tasks, and results on
semantic generation, text completion and summarization show its effectiveness
in generating high-quality long-form text in an efficient manner.

                                        <span>  Previous research in multi-document news summarization has typically
concentrated on collating information that all sources agree upon. However, the
summarization of diverse information dispersed across multiple articles about
an event remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a new task of
summarizing diverse information encountered in multiple news articles
encompassing the same event. To facilitate this task, we outlined a data
collection schema for identifying diverse information and curated a dataset
named DiverseSumm. The dataset includes 245 news stories, with each story
comprising 10 news articles and paired with a human-validated reference. Next,
to enable consistent automatic evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive
analysis to pinpoint the position and verbosity biases when utilizing Large
Language Model (LLM)-based metrics for evaluating the coverage and faithfulness
of summaries. Through correlation analyses, we outline the best practices for
effectively using automatic LLM-based metrics on the DiverseSumm dataset.
Finally, we study how LLMs summarize multiple news articles by analyzing which
type of diverse information LLMs are capable of identifying. Our analyses
suggest that despite the extraordinary capabilities of LLMs in single-document
summarization, the proposed task remains a complex challenge for them mainly
due to their limited coverage, with GPT-4 only able to cover under 40% of the
diverse information on average.

                                        <span>  The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual
contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain
insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to
incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which
potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the
input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math
benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We
meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with
diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by
human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of
information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in
total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how
much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.
In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a
fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True
or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and
then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the
intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark
may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project

reasoning with foundation models. Recently, efforts have been made to train
language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and
action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories
still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or
implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose
A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent
Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting
agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly
sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent
with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then
synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled
action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for
the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed
trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods
with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated
trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent
self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the
open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with
A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative
rounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human
average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance
approaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing
techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and
fully fine-tuned LLMs.

                                        <span>  The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether large language models trained on
multi-choice question data can be used to discriminate between medical
subjects. This is an important and challenging task for automatic question
answering. To achieve this goal, we train deep neural networks for multi-class
classification of questions into the inferred medical subjects. Using our
Multi-Question (MQ) Sequence-BERT method, we outperform the state-of-the-art
results on the MedMCQA dataset with an accuracy of 0.68 and 0.60 on their
development and test sets, respectively. In this sense, we show the capability
of AI and LLMs in particular for multi-classification tasks in the Healthcare
domain.

score more structured math and computer science assessments, they often do not
provide explanations for the scores. Our study focuses on employing GPT-4 for
automated assessment in middle school Earth Science, combining few-shot and

                                        <span>  Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating
collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the
inherent limitations of LLMs. We propose a novel perspective called semantic
decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures
in semantic space. Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors
that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens
(known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors,
including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors.
Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic
tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these
orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching
in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct
parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves
crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for
extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the
semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective
on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much
greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the
transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between
syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of
optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding
algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions
arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a
powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of
meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new
type of computation.

                                        <span>  Today's most accurate language models are trained on orders of magnitude more
language data than human language learners receive - but with no supervision
from other sensory modalities that play a crucial role in human learning. Can
we make LMs' representations and predictions more accurate (and more
human-like) with more ecologically plausible supervision? This paper describes
LexiContrastive Grounding (LCG), a grounded language learning procedure that
leverages visual supervision to improve textual representations.
LexiContrastive Grounding combines a next token prediction strategy with a
contrastive visual grounding objective, focusing on early-layer representations
that encode lexical information. Across multiple word-learning and
sentence-understanding benchmarks, LexiContrastive Grounding not only
outperforms standard language-only models in learning efficiency, but also
improves upon vision-and-language learning procedures including CLIP, GIT,
Flamingo, and Vokenization. Moreover, LexiContrastive Grounding improves
perplexity by around 5% on multiple language modeling tasks. This work
underscores the potential of incorporating visual grounding into language
models, aligning more closely with the multimodal nature of human language
acquisition.

                                        <span>  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a wide range of downstream language tasks. Temperature
sampling is a commonly used decoding strategy for LLMs' generation process.
However, a fixed temperature parameter is used in most cases, which may not
always be an optimal choice for balancing generation quality and diversity. In
this paper, we propose an effective Entropy-based Dynamic Temperature (EDT)
Sampling method, to achieve a more balanced performance in terms of both
generation quality and diversity by dynamically selecting the temperature
parameter. Additionally, we also show model performance and comprehensive
analyses for 4 different generation benchmarks. Our experiments show that EDT
significantly outperforms the existing strategies across different tasks.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large
Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine
unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive
metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments to compare knowledge
editing approaches with previous baselines, indicating that knowledge editing
has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general
performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed
Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the
toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further
provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify
approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely
suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity
of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We
hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing
detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code

                                        <span>  Researchers and developers increasingly rely on toxicity scoring to moderate
generative language model outputs, in settings such as customer service,
information retrieval, and content generation. However, toxicity scoring may
render pertinent information inaccessible, rigidify or "value-lock" cultural
norms, and prevent language reclamation processes, particularly for
marginalized people. In this work, we extend the concept of algorithmic
recourse to generative language models: we provide users a novel mechanism to
achieve their desired prediction by dynamically setting thresholds for toxicity
filtering. Users thereby exercise increased agency relative to interactions
with the baseline system. A pilot study ($n = 30$) supports the potential of
our proposed recourse mechanism, indicating improvements in usability compared
to fixed-threshold toxicity-filtering of model outputs. Future work should
explore the intersection of toxicity scoring, model controllability, user
agency, and language reclamation processes -- particularly with regard to the
bias that many communities encounter when interacting with generative language
models.

vehicle software systems, where the end architecture is not explicitly defined.
Instead, it emerges from an iterative process of search and optimization given
certain constraints, requirements and hardware architecture, while retaining
the property of single-system illusion, where applications run in a logically
uniform environment. One of the key points of the presented approach is the
inclusion of modern generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs),
in the loop. With the recent advances in the field, we expect that the LLMs
will be able to assist in processing of requirements, generation of formal
system models, as well as generation of software deployment specification and
test code. The resulting pipeline is automated to a large extent, with feedback
being generated at each step.

applied to text classification. This work focuses on their extension to
generative language models. To address the challenges of text as output and
long text inputs, we propose a general framework called MExGen that can be
instantiated with different attribution algorithms. To handle text output, we
introduce the notion of scalarizers for mapping text to real numbers and
investigate multiple possibilities. To handle long inputs, we take a
multi-level approach, proceeding from coarser levels of granularity to finer
ones, and focus on algorithms with linear scaling in model queries. We conduct
a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based
attribution methods for summarization and context-grounded question answering.
The results show that our framework can provide more locally faithful
explanations of generated outputs.

tables is an open research problem. One of the primary challenges in
automatically generating tables is ensuring their syntactic validity. Prior
approaches address this challenge by including additional parameters in the
Transformer's attention mechanism to attend to specific rows and column
headers. In contrast to this single-stage method, this paper presents a
two-stage approach called Generative Tables (gTBLS). The first stage infers
table structure (row and column headers) from the text. The second stage
formulates questions using these headers and fine-tunes a causal language model
to answer them. Furthermore, the gTBLS approach is amenable to the utilization
of pre-trained Large Language Models in a zero-shot configuration, presenting a
solution for table generation in situations where fine-tuning is not feasible.
gTBLS improves prior approaches by up to 10% in BERTScore on the table
construction task and up to 20% on the table content generation task of the
E2E, WikiTableText, WikiBio, and RotoWire datasets.

enhancing the accuracy of translations. In contrast, the process of
human-generated translation relies on a wide range of translation techniques,
which are crucial for ensuring linguistic adequacy and fluency. This study
suggests that these translation techniques could further optimize machine
translation if they are automatically identified before being applied to guide
the translation process effectively. The study differentiates between two
scenarios of the translation process: from-scratch translation and
post-editing. For each scenario, a specific set of experiments has been
designed to forecast the most appropriate translation techniques. The findings
indicate that the predictive accuracy for from-scratch translation reaches 82%,
while the post-editing process exhibits even greater potential, achieving an
accuracy rate of 93%.

a highlysimilar way to fluent speakers (Panther et al.,2024). This ability is
assumed to derive through the identification and extraction of statistically
recurrent forms. We examine this assumption by asking how NMS segmentations
compare to those produced by Morfessor, an unsupervised machine learning model
that operates based on statistical recurrence, across words formed by a variety
of morphological processes. Both NMS and Morfessor succeed in segmenting words
formed by concatenative processes (compounding and affixation without
allomorphy), but NMS also succeed for words that invoke templates
(reduplication and allomorphy) and other cues to morphological structure,
implying that their learning process is sensitive to more than just statistical
recurrence.

                                        <span>  This work addresses the buyer's inspection paradox for information markets.
The paradox is that buyers need to access information to determine its value,
while sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. To study this, we
introduce an open-source simulated digital marketplace where intelligent
agents, powered by language models, buy and sell information on behalf of
external participants. The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the
agents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the
quality of privileged information but also come equipped with the ability to
forget. This ability to induce amnesia allows vendors to grant temporary access
to proprietary information, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
retention while enabling agents to accurately gauge the information's relevance
to specific queries or tasks. To perform well, agents must make rational
decisions, strategically explore the marketplace through generated sub-queries,
and synthesize answers from purchased information. Concretely, our experiments
(a) uncover biases in language models leading to irrational behavior and
evaluate techniques to mitigate these biases, (b) investigate how price affects
demand in the context of informational goods, and (c) show that inspection and
higher budgets both lead to higher quality outcomes.

trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the
assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the
requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We
explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only
acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the
decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best
hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we
explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as
well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields
relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of
up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank
adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.

                                        <span>  Language models and humans are two types of learning systems. Finding or
facilitating commonalities could enable major breakthroughs in our
understanding of the acquisition and evolution of language. Many theories of
language evolution rely heavily on learning biases and learning pressures. Yet
due to substantial differences in learning pressures, it is questionable
whether the similarity between humans and machines is sufficient for insights
to carry over and to be worth testing with human participants. Here, we review
the emergent communication literature, a subfield of multi-agent reinforcement
learning, from a language evolution perspective. We find that the emergent
communication literature excels at designing and adapting models to recover
initially absent linguistic phenomena of natural languages. Based on a short
literature review, we identify key pressures that have recovered initially
absent human patterns in emergent communication models: communicative success,
efficiency, learnability, and other psycho-/sociolinguistic factors. We argue
that this may serve as inspiration for how to design language models for
language acquisition and language evolution research.

facts and human cognition which contain human preferences. However, this
process can inadvertently lead to these models acquiring biases and stereotypes
prevalent in society. Prior research has typically tackled the issue of bias
through a one-dimensional perspective, concentrating either on locating or
mitigating it. This limited perspective has created obstacles in facilitating
research on bias to synergistically complement and progressively build upon one
another. In this study, we integrate the processes of locating and mitigating
bias within a unified framework. Initially, we use causal mediation analysis to
trace the causal effects of different components' activation within a large
language model. Building on this, we propose the LSDM (Least Square Debias
Method), a knowledge-editing based method for mitigating gender bias in
occupational pronouns, and compare it against two baselines on three gender
bias datasets and seven knowledge competency test datasets. The experimental
results indicate that the primary contributors to gender bias are the bottom
MLP modules acting on the last token of occupational pronouns and the top
attention module acting on the final word in the sentence. Furthermore, LSDM
mitigates gender bias in the model more effectively than the other baselines,
while fully preserving the model's capabilities in all other aspects.

non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into LLMs, have emerged
as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy in several tasks, such
as Question-Answering (QA). However, even though there are various approaches
dealing with queries of different complexities, they either handle simple
queries with unnecessary computational overhead or fail to adequately address
complex multi-step queries; yet, not all user requests fall into only one of
the simple or complex categories. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive QA
framework, that can dynamically select the most suitable strategy for
(retrieval-augmented) LLMs from the simplest to the most sophisticated ones
based on the query complexity. Also, this selection process is operationalized
with a classifier, which is a smaller LM trained to predict the complexity
level of incoming queries with automatically collected labels, obtained from
actual predicted outcomes of models and inherent inductive biases in datasets.
This approach offers a balanced strategy, seamlessly adapting between the
iterative and single-step retrieval-augmented LLMs, as well as the no-retrieval
methods, in response to a range of query complexities. We validate our model on
a set of open-domain QA datasets, covering multiple query complexities, and
show that ours enhances the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems,
compared to relevant baselines including the adaptive retrieval approaches.

which are frequent in realistic environments. Augmenting these systems with
visual signals has the potential to improve robustness to noise. However,
audio-visual (AV) data is only available in limited amounts and for fewer
languages than audio-only resources. To address this gap, we present XLAVS-R, a
cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model for noise-robust speech
recognition and translation in over 100 languages. It is designed to maximize
the benefits of limited multilingual AV pre-training data, by building on top
of audio-only multilingual pre-training and simplifying existing pre-training
schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of
XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks,
where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7
BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability
with audio-only fine-tuning.

translation capabilities, even competing with supervised-trained commercial
translation systems. However, off-target translation remains an unsolved
problem, especially for low-resource languages, hindering us from developing
accurate LLMs-based translation models. To mitigate the off-target translation
problem and enhance the performance of LLMs on translation, recent works have
either designed advanced prompting strategies to highlight the functionality of
translation instructions or exploited the in-context learning ability of LLMs
by feeding few-shot demonstrations. However, these methods essentially do not
improve LLM's ability to follow translation instructions, especially the
language direction information. In this work, we design a two-stage fine-tuning
algorithm to improve the instruction-following ability (especially the
translation direction) of LLMs. Specifically, we first tune LLMs with the
maximum likelihood estimation loss on the translation dataset to elicit the
basic translation capabilities. In the second stage, we construct
instruction-conflicting samples by randomly replacing the translation
directions with a wrong one within the instruction, and then introduce an extra
unlikelihood loss to learn those samples. Experiments on IWSLT and WMT
benchmarks upon the LLaMA model spanning 16 zero-shot directions show that,
compared to the competitive baseline -- translation-finetuned LLama, our method
could effectively reduce the off-target translation ratio (averagely -53.3\%),
thus improving translation quality with average +5.7 SacreBLEU and +16.4
BLEURT. Analysis shows that our method could preserve the model's general task
performance on AlpacaEval. Code and models will be released at

Problems (MWPs) through full supervision with intermediate equations, recent
works have proposed weakly supervised task settings that rely solely on the
final answer as a supervised signal. Existing leading approaches typically
employ various search techniques to infer intermediate equations, but cannot
ensure their semantic consistency with natural language descriptions. The rise
of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has opened up new possibilities
for addressing MWPs directly. However, the computational demands of LLMs make
them less than ideal for use in settings where resources are tight. In light of
these challenges, we introduce an innovative two-stage framework that adeptly
transfers mathematical Expertise from large to tiny language models. In
\emph{Distillation Stage}, we propose a series of extraction processes that
satisfy the properties of MWPs to distill mathematical knowledge from LLMs to
construct problem-equation pairs required for supervised training. In
\emph{Refinement Stage}, Due to Knowledge distilling method cannot guarantee
the full utilization of all data, we further utilize the unsuccessfully
searched data effectively by Knowledge Refine method. Finally, We train a small
model using distilled data generated through two-stage methods. As our method
fully leverages the semantic understanding capabilities during the searching
'problem-equation' pair, it demonstrates significantly improved performance on
the Math23K and Weak12K datasets compared to existing small model methods,
while maintaining a much lower computational cost than ChatGPT.

store factual knowledge about various aspects of the world described in texts.
Current technologies typically employ knowledge editing methods or specific
prompts to modify LM outputs. However, existing knowledge editing methods are
costly and inefficient, struggling to produce appropriate text. Additionally,
prompt engineering is opaque and requires significant effort to find suitable
prompts. To address these issues, we introduce a new method called PSPEM
(Prefix Soft Prompt Editing Method), that can be used for a lifetime with just
one training. It resolves the inefficiencies and generalizability issues in
knowledge editing methods and overcomes the opacity of prompt engineering by
automatically seeking optimal soft prompts. Specifically, PSPEM utilizes a
prompt encoder and an encoding converter to refine key information in prompts
and uses prompt alignment techniques to guide model generation, ensuring text
consistency and adherence to the intended structure and content, thereby
maintaining an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. We have
validated the effectiveness of PSPEM through knowledge editing and attribute
inserting. On the COUNTERFACT dataset, PSPEM achieved nearly 100\% editing
accuracy and demonstrated the highest level of fluency. We further analyzed the
similarities between PSPEM and original prompts and their impact on the model's
internals. The results indicate that PSPEM can serve as an alternative to
original prompts, supporting the model in effective editing.

                                        <span>  Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large
Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is
impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively
treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment
it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG.
Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and
has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune
the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved
documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual
Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual
information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt
the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating
all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for
LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the
factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for
augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by
constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by
introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer.
FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated
by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets:
TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of
Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA,
respectively. Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on
average across the three datasets.

events posterior to their training are "unknown" to them. One way to keep
models up-to-date could be factual update: the task of inserting, replacing, or
removing certain simple (atomic) facts within the model. To study this task, we
present WikiFactDiff, a dataset that describes the evolution of factual
knowledge between two dates as a collection of simple facts divided into three
categories: new, obsolete, and static. We describe several update scenarios
arising from various combinations of these three types of basic update. The
facts are represented by subject-relation-object triples; indeed, WikiFactDiff
was constructed by comparing the state of the Wikidata knowledge base at 4
January 2021 and 27 February 2023. Those fact are accompanied by verbalization
templates and cloze tests that enable running update algorithms and their
evaluation metrics. Contrary to other datasets, such as zsRE and CounterFact,
WikiFactDiff constitutes a realistic update setting that involves various
update scenarios, including replacements, archival, and new entity insertions.
We also present an evaluation of existing update algorithms on WikiFactDiff.

over time in the company's financial and operational situations, which is
critical for financial decision-making. We find that existing pretrained
embedding models and LLM embeddings fall short in discerning these subtle
financial narrative shifts. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-augmented
pipeline specifically designed for the Financial-STS task. Evaluation on a
human-annotated dataset demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms
existing methods trained on classic STS tasks and generic LLM embeddings.

certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant
attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection
regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks,
including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number
of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data
portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more
effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and
Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework
designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It
applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using
standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple
benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections
of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various
unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable
across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$
requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than
retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness
using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics,
demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.

large language models (LLMs), establishing itself as a primary approach to
solving complex reasoning tasks. Existing CoT synthesis approaches usually
focus on simpler reasoning tasks and thus result in low-quality and
inconsistent CoT prompts. In response to this challenge, we present an
empirical investigation of CoT prompting and introduce CoTGenius, a novel
framework designed for the automatic generation of superior CoT prompts.
CoTGenius is developed based on three major evolution strategies, i.e.,
complicate, diversify, and specify-alongside two filtering mechanisms:
evolutionary success judgement and correctness verification. We further employ
CoTGenius to create an extensive CoT dataset, and subsequently fine-tune the
Llama 2-Chat 7B and 13B models on this dataset. We call the resulting model
ChainLM. To deal with the cumulative error issue in reasoning steps, we propose
a step-level debating method, wherein multiple debaters discuss each reasoning
step to arrive at the correct answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our ChainLM models exhibit enhanced proficiency in addressing a spectrum of
complex reasoning problems compared to existing models. In addition, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the impact of data categories within CoTGenius on the
model performance. We release our dataset and code at

reference-based. However, the challenge of collecting human annotation results
in a lack of reliable references in numerous application scenarios. Despite
recent advancements in reference-free metrics, it has not been well understood
when and where they can be used as an alternative to reference-based metrics.
In this study, by employing diverse analytical approaches, we comprehensively
assess the performance of both metrics across a wide range of NLG tasks,
encompassing eight datasets and eight evaluation models. Based on solid
experiments, the results show that reference-free metrics exhibit a higher
correlation with human judgment and greater sensitivity to deficiencies in
language quality. However, their effectiveness varies across tasks and is
influenced by the quality of candidate texts. Therefore, it's important to
assess the performance of reference-free metrics before applying them to a new
task, especially when inputs are in uncommon form or when the answer space is
highly variable. Our study can provide insight into the appropriate application
of automatic metrics and the impact of metric choice on evaluation performance.

relationships in images. Prior methods approach this task by adding separate
relationship modules or decoders to existing object detection architectures.
This separation increases complexity and hinders end-to-end training, which
limits performance. We propose a simple and highly efficient decoder-free
architecture for open-vocabulary visual relationship detection. Our model
consists of a Transformer-based image encoder that represents objects as tokens
and models their relationships implicitly. To extract relationship information,
we introduce an attention mechanism that selects object pairs likely to form a
relationship. We provide a single-stage recipe to train this model on a mixture
of object and relationship detection data. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art relationship detection performance on Visual Genome and on the
large-vocabulary GQA benchmark at real-time inference speeds. We provide
analyses of zero-shot performance, ablations, and real-world qualitative
examples.

                                        <span>  Already since the 1950s TRIZ shows that patents and the technical
contradictions they solve are an important source of inspiration for the
development of innovative products. However, TRIZ is a heuristic based on a
historic patent analysis and does not make use of the ever-increasing number of
latest technological solutions in current patents. Because of the huge number
of patents, their length, and, last but not least, their complexity there is a
need for modern patent retrieval and patent analysis to go beyond
keyword-oriented methods. Recent advances in patent retrieval and analysis
mainly focus on dense vectors based on neural AI Transformer language models
like Google BERT. They are, for example, used for dense retrieval, question
answering or summarization and key concept extraction. A research focus within
the methods for patent summarization and key concept extraction are generic
inventive concepts respectively TRIZ concepts like problems, solutions,
advantage of invention, parameters, and contradictions. Succeeding rule-based
approaches, finetuned BERT-like language models for sentence-wise
classification represent the state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction.
While they work comparatively well for basic concepts like problems or
solutions, contradictions - as a more complex abstraction - remain a challenge
for these models. This paper goes one step further, as it presents a method to
extract TRIZ contradictions from patent texts based on Prompt Engineering using
a generative Large Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI's GPT-4. Contradiction
detection, sentence extraction, contradiction summarization, parameter
extraction and assignment to the 39 abstract TRIZ engineering parameters are
all performed in a single prompt using the LangChain framework. Our results
show that "off-the-shelf" GPT-4 is a serious alternative to existing
approaches.

Models (LLMs) is garnering a significant attention in recent years. Recognizing
cognitive distortions from the interviewee's utterances can be an essential
part of psychotherapy, especially for cognitive behavioral therapy. In this
paper, we propose ERD, which improves LLM-based cognitive distortion
classification performance with the aid of additional modules of (1) extracting
the parts related to cognitive distortion, and (2) debating the reasoning steps
by multiple agents. Our experimental results on a public dataset show that ERD
improves the multi-class F1 score as well as binary specificity score.
Regarding the latter score, it turns out that our method is effective in
debiasing the baseline method which has high false positive rate, especially
when the summary of multi-agent debate is provided to LLMs.

                                        <span>  In many literary texts, emotions are indirectly conveyed through descriptions
of actions, facial expressions, and appearances, necessitating emotion
inference for narrative understanding. In this paper, we introduce K-Act2Emo, a
Korean commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) comprising 1,900 indirect emotional
expressions and the emotions inferable from them. We categorize reasoning types
into inferences in positive situations, inferences in negative situations, and
inferences when expressions do not serve as emotional cues. Unlike existing
CSKGs, K-Act2Emo specializes in emotional contexts, and experimental results
validate its effectiveness for training emotion inference models.
Significantly, the BART-based knowledge model fine-tuned with K-Act2Emo
outperforms various existing Korean large language models, achieving
performance levels comparable to GPT-4 Turbo.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for
understanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks,
such as document image classification and information extraction, have gained
significant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been
developed to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training
awareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require
fine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train
and operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that
integrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the
strengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs'
superior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned
with multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document
images in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the
baseline model in various document analysis tasks.

medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast
complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines
machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately,
large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an
Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the
diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of
dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this
domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models
and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a
nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and
facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology
through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation
pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin
conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance,
advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed
which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference.
Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a
structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the
proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores
of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy,
demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological
analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the
development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote
consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.

leads to superficial alignment, prioritizing stylistic changes over improving
downstream performance of LLMs. Underspecified preferences could obscure
directions to align the models. Lacking exploration restricts identification of
desirable outputs to improve the models. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework: Reinforcement Learning from Reflective Feedback
(RLRF), which leverages fine-grained feedback based on detailed criteria to
improve the core capabilities of LLMs. RLRF employs a self-reflection mechanism
to systematically explore and refine LLM responses, then fine-tuning the models
via a RL algorithm along with promising responses. Our experiments across
Just-Eval, Factuality, and Mathematical Reasoning demonstrate the efficacy and
transformative potential of RLRF beyond superficial surface-level adjustment.

                                        <span>  Model editing is a growing area focused on updating the knowledge embedded
within models. Among the various methodologies, ROME and MEMIT stand out as
leading "locate-and-edit" model editing techniques. While MEMIT enables batched
editing of memories, ROME is limited to changing one fact at a time. This paper
introduces a unifying framework that brings ROME and MEMIT under a single
conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the
"preservation-memorization" objective. This objective aims to preserve the
representations of certain selected vectors while memorizing the
representations of new factual information. Specifically, ROME optimizes this
objective using an equality constraint, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible
least-square constraint. In addition to making batched edits, MEMIT also edits
the model at multiple layers. We disentangle the distribution of edits to
multiple layers from the optimization objective of MEMIT and show that these
edit-distribution algorithms should be considered separate entities worthy of
their own line of research.
  Finally, we present EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing
algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. With EMMET,
we present a closed form solution for the equality-constrained version of the
preservation-memorization objective. We show that EMMET is able to perform
batched-edits on par with MEMIT up to a batch-size of 256 and discuss the
challenges in stabilizing EMMET. By articulating the "locate-and-edit" model
editing algorithms under a simple conceptual framework of
"preservation-memorization", we aim to bridge the gap between intuition and
mathematics and hope to simplify the journey for future researchers in model
editing.

using only a few annotated examples. One promising line of research is to
leverage natural language descriptions of each entity type: the common label
PER might, for example, be verbalized as ''person entity.'' In an initial label
interpretation learning phase, the model learns to interpret such verbalized
descriptions of entity types. In a subsequent few-shot tagset extension phase,
this model is then given a description of a previously unseen entity type (such
as ''music album'') and optionally a few training examples to perform few-shot
NER for this type. In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of a
strong semantic prior to interpret verbalizations of new entity types by
massively scaling up the number and granularity of entity types used for label
interpretation learning. To this end, we leverage an entity linking benchmark
to create a dataset with orders of magnitude of more distinct entity types and
descriptions as currently used datasets. We find that this increased signal
yields strong results in zero- and few-shot NER in in-domain, cross-domain, and
even cross-lingual settings. Our findings indicate significant potential for
improving few-shot NER through heuristical data-based optimization.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in following user
instructions and generating helpful responses. Nevertheless, their robustness
is still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent
responses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions. Recent
literature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance
of continued improvement in the robustness of response generation. However,
systematic analysis and solutions are still lacking. In this paper, we
quantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage
training framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning
and consistency alignment training. The first stage helps a model generalize on
following instructions via similar instruction augmentations. In the second
stage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses
are more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences
in similar responses. The training process is accomplished by self-rewards
inferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to
external human preference resources. We conduct extensive experiments on recent
publicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our training framework.

                                        <span>  The acquisition of grammar has been a central question to adjudicate between
theories of language acquisition. In order to conduct faster, more
reproducible, and larger-scale corpus studies on grammaticality in
child-caregiver conversations, tools for automatic annotation can offer an
effective alternative to tedious manual annotation. We propose a coding scheme
for context-dependent grammaticality in child-caregiver conversations and
annotate more than 4,000 utterances from a large corpus of transcribed
conversations. Based on these annotations, we train and evaluate a range of NLP
models. Our results show that fine-tuned Transformer-based models perform best,
achieving human inter-annotation agreement levels.As a first application and
sanity check of this tool, we use the trained models to annotate a corpus
almost two orders of magnitude larger than the manually annotated data and
verify that children's grammaticality shows a steady increase with age.This
work contributes to the growing literature on applying state-of-the-art NLP
methods to help study child language acquisition at scale.

model by providing additional relevant external knowledge (context) during
generation. Although it has been shown that the quantity and quality of context
impact the performance of retrieval-augmented generation models during
inference, limited research explores how these characteristics affect model
training. This paper explores how context quantity and quality during model
training affect the performance of Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD), the
state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation model, in extractive
open-domain question answering tasks. Experimental results suggest that FiD
models overfit to context quality during training and show suboptimal
performance when evaluated on different context quality. Through the
experimental results, we also reveal FiD models trained with different context
quality have different cross-attention distribution patterns. Specifically, as
context quality during training increases, FiD models tend to attend more
uniformly to each passage in context. Finally, based on these observations, we
propose a method to mitigate overfitting to specific context quality by
introducing bias to the cross-attention distribution, which we demonstrate to
be effective in improving the performance of FiD models on different context
quality.

                                        <span>  Automatic detection of multimodal misinformation has gained a widespread
attention recently. However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models
(LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides,
how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and
accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a
framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual
explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To
convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following
format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline
consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval
module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to
extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal
misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation
approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal
misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions
regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks,
we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and
conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our
MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to
provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.

information including speech, the facial and body movements of the speakers, as
well as the texts and pictures in the slides and possibly even the papers.
Although multiple academic video datasets have been constructed and released,
few of them support both multimodal content recognition and understanding
tasks, which is partially due to the lack of high-quality human annotations. In
this paper, we propose a novel multimodal, multigenre, and multipurpose
audio-visual academic lecture dataset (M$^3$AV), which has almost 367 hours of
videos from five sources covering computer science, mathematics, and medical

for multiple audio-visual recognition and understanding tasks. Evaluations
performed on contextual speech recognition, speech synthesis, and slide and

model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is
the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language
models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to
improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration-a crucial aspect
for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration
methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical
for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during
test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through
a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects
the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature
dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average
Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration
error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),
for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through
extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show
that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning
without needing labeled data.

decades of evolution, QE has yielded a wealth of results. This article provides
a comprehensive overview of QE datasets, annotation methods, shared tasks,
methodologies, challenges, and future research directions. It begins with an
introduction to the background and significance of QE, followed by an
explanation of the concepts and evaluation metrics for word-level QE,
sentence-level QE, document-level QE, and explainable QE. The paper categorizes
the methods developed throughout the history of QE into those based on
handcrafted features, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs), with a
further division of deep learning-based methods into classic deep learning and
those incorporating pre-trained language models (LMs). Additionally, the
article details the advantages and limitations of each method and offers a
straightforward comparison of different approaches. Finally, the paper
discusses the current challenges in QE research and provides an outlook on
future research directions.

                                        <span>  In our era of rapid technological advancement, the research landscape for
writing assistants has become increasingly fragmented across various research
communities. We seek to address this challenge by proposing a design space as a
structured way to examine and explore the multidimensional space of intelligent
and interactive writing assistants. Through a large community collaboration, we
explore five aspects of writing assistants: task, user, technology,
interaction, and ecosystem. Within each aspect, we define dimensions (i.e.,
fundamental components of an aspect) and codes (i.e., potential options for
each dimension) by systematically reviewing 115 papers. Our design space aims
to offer researchers and designers a practical tool to navigate, comprehend,
and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid in the
envisioning and design of new writing assistants.

evaluating the commonsense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in
Chinese, which covers both globally known and Chinese-specific commonsense. We
evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5
representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as
Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and
the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which
enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning
and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing
Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show
differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also
evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed
the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and
weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve
as a reference for studies in other fields. We will release CHARM at

method for representation learning and is widely used for dense retrieval.
However, we identify that relying solely on contrastive learning can lead to
suboptimal retrieval performance. On the other hand, despite many retrieval
datasets supporting various learning objectives beyond contrastive learning,
combining them efficiently in multi-task learning scenarios can be challenging.
In this paper, we introduce M3, an advanced recursive Multi-hop dense sentence
retrieval system built upon a novel Multi-task Mixed-objective approach for
dense text representation learning, addressing the aforementioned challenges.
Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale open-domain
fact verification benchmark dataset, FEVER. Code and data are available at:

                                        <span>  Ambiguity is an critical component of language that allows for more effective
communication between speakers, but is often ignored in NLP. Recent work
suggests that NLP systems may struggle to grasp certain elements of human
language understanding because they may not handle ambiguities at the level
that humans naturally do in communication. Additionally, different types of
ambiguity may serve different purposes and require different approaches for
resolution, and we aim to investigate how language models' abilities vary
across types. We propose a taxonomy of ambiguity types as seen in English to
facilitate NLP analysis. Our taxonomy can help make meaningful splits in
language ambiguity data, allowing for more fine-grained assessments of both
datasets and model performance.

learning (ML) experts from various audio domains. There are several valuable
audio-driven ML tasks, from speech emotion recognition to audio event
detection, but the community is sparse compared to other ML areas, e.g.,
computer vision or natural language processing. A major limitation with audio
is the available data; with audio being a time-dependent modality, high-quality
data collection is time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for
academic groups to apply their often state-of-the-art strategies to a larger,
more generalizable dataset. In this short white paper, to encourage researchers
with limited access to large-datasets, the organizers first outline several
open-source datasets that are available to the community, and for the duration
of the workshop are making several propriety datasets available. Namely, three
vocal datasets, Hume-Prosody, Hume-VocalBurst, an acted emotional speech
dataset Modulate-Sonata, and an in-game streamer dataset Modulate-Stream. We
outline the current baselines on these datasets but encourage researchers from
across audio to utilize them outside of the initial baseline tasks.

However, current text-to-3D methods often generate 3D results that do not align
well with human preferences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-to-3D models from
human preference feedback. To begin with, we collect 25k expert comparisons
based on a systematic annotation pipeline including rating and ranking. Then,
we build Reward3D -- the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference
reward model to effectively encode human preferences. Building upon the 3D
reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D
Feedback Learning (DreamFL), a direct tuning algorithm to optimize the
multi-view diffusion models with a redefined scorer. Grounded by theoretical
proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our DreamReward successfully
generates high-fidelity and 3D consistent results with significant boosts in
prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great
potential for learning from human feedback to improve text-to-3D models.

                                        <span>  Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) is an underexplored yet pivotal
issue, involving the dynamic addition of new classes in the context of
federated learning. In this field, Data-Free Knowledge Transfer (DFKT) plays a
crucial role in addressing catastrophic forgetting and data privacy problems.
However, prior approaches lack the crucial synergy between DFKT and the model
training phases, causing DFKT to encounter difficulties in generating
high-quality data from a non-anchored latent space of the old task model. In
this paper, we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge
Transfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE)
produced by pretrained language models. Specifically, during the model training
phase, our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature
embeddings of corresponding training samples around them, enriching the
surrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase, by using
these LTE anchors, LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples, thereby
effectively addressing the forgetting problem. Additionally, instead of tightly
constraining embeddings toward the anchor, the Bounding Loss is introduced to
encourage sample embeddings to remain flexible within a defined radius. This
approach preserves the natural differences in sample embeddings and mitigates
the embedding overlap caused by heterogeneous federated settings. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet demonstrate that
LANDER significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in FCIL. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that aims to
identify and extract the emotional aspects of a text. However, many existing
sentiment analysis methods primarily classify the overall polarity of a text,
overlooking the specific phrases that convey sentiment. In this paper, we
applied an approach to sentiment analysis based on a question-answering
framework. Our approach leverages the power of Bidirectional Autoregressive
Transformer (BART), a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, to extract a
phrase from a given text that amplifies a given sentiment polarity. We create a
natural language question that identifies the specific emotion to extract and
then guide BART to pay attention to the relevant emotional cues in the text. We
use a classifier within BART to predict the start and end positions of the
answer span within the text, which helps to identify the precise boundaries of
the extracted emotion phrase. Our approach offers several advantages over most
sentiment analysis studies, including capturing the complete context and
meaning of the text and extracting precise token spans that highlight the
intended sentiment. We achieved an end loss of 87% and Jaccard score of 0.61.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in
comprehending and generating text, motivating numerous researchers to utilize
them for Information Extraction (IE) purposes, including Relation Extraction
(RE). Nonetheless, most existing methods are predominantly designed for
Sentence-level Relation Extraction (SentRE) tasks, which typically encompass a
restricted set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence.
Furthermore, certain approaches resort to treating relations as candidate
choices integrated into prompt templates, leading to inefficient processing and
suboptimal performance when tackling Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE)
tasks, which entail handling multiple relations and triplet facts distributed
across a given document, posing distinct challenges. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce AutoRE, an end-to-end DocRE model that adopts a novel
RE extraction paradigm named RHF (Relation-Head-Facts). Unlike existing
approaches, AutoRE does not rely on the assumption of known relation options,
making it more reflective of real-world scenarios. Additionally, we have
developed an easily extensible RE framework using a Parameters Efficient Fine
Tuning (PEFT) algorithm (QLoRA). Our experiments on the RE-DocRED dataset
showcase AutoRE's best performance, achieving state-of-the-art results,
surpassing TAG by 10.03% and 9.03% respectively on the dev and test set.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose VidLA, an approach for video-language alignment at
scale. There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment
approaches. First, they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal
dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network
architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text
foundation models. To effectively address this limitation, we instead keep the
network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at
different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner, accounting for the
temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower
architecture, we are able to initialize our video-language model with
pretrained image-text foundation models, thereby boosting the final
performance. Second, existing video-language alignment works struggle due to
the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it, we
leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with
better visual grounding. Furthermore, unlike existing video-text datasets which
only contain short clips, our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying
durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better
representations at varying temporal scales. Overall, empirical results show
that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple
retrieval benchmarks, especially on longer videos, and performs competitively
on classification benchmarks.

which greatly facilitates interaction with human users. However, prompt-based
approaches might not always be able to tap into the wealth of implicit
knowledge acquired by LLMs during pre-training. This paper presents a
comprehensive study of ways to evaluate semantic plausibility in LLMs. We
compare base and instruction-tuned LLM performance on an English sentence
plausibility task via (a) explicit prompting and (b) implicit estimation via
direct readout of the probabilities models assign to strings. Experiment 1
shows that, across model architectures and plausibility datasets, (i) log
likelihood ($\textit{LL}$) scores are the most reliable indicator of sentence
plausibility, with zero-shot prompting yielding inconsistent and typically poor
results; (ii) $\textit{LL}$-based performance is still inferior to human
performance; (iii) instruction-tuned models have worse $\textit{LL}$-based
performance than base models. In Experiment 2, we show that $\textit{LL}$
scores across models are modulated by context in the expected way, showing high
performance on three metrics of context-sensitive plausibility and providing a
direct match to explicit human plausibility judgments. Overall, $\textit{LL}$
estimates remain a more reliable measure of plausibility in LLMs than direct
prompting.

                                        <span>  Canonical morphological segmentation is the process of analyzing words into
the standard (aka underlying) forms of their constituent morphemes. This is a
core task in language documentation, and NLP systems have the potential to
dramatically speed up this process. But in typical language documentation
settings, training data for canonical morpheme segmentation is scarce, making
it difficult to train high quality models. However, translation data is often
much more abundant, and, in this work, we present a method that attempts to
leverage this data in the canonical segmentation task. We propose a
character-level sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates representations of
translations obtained from pretrained high-resource monolingual language models
as an additional signal. Our model outperforms the baseline in a super-low
resource setting but yields mixed results on training splits with more data.
While further work is needed to make translations useful in higher-resource
settings, our model shows promise in severely resource-constrained settings.

                                        <span>  Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing
realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately
expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)
has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale
solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already
been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the
extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,
assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive
impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application
to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks.
The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible
development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical
is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance
mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including
those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all
stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will
minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs
will positively impact mental health globally.

training speech synthesizers, evaluating machine translation, and assessing
learner productions. While there exist measures for semantic similarity and
prosodic similarity, there are as yet none for pragmatic similarity. To enable
the training of such measures, we developed the first collection of human
judgments of pragmatic similarity between utterance pairs. Each pair consisting
of an utterance extracted from a recorded dialog and a re-enactment of that
utterance. Re-enactments were done under various conditions designed to create
a variety of degrees of similarity. Each pair was rated on a continuous scale
by 6 to 9 judges. The average inter-judge correlation was as high as 0.72 for
English and 0.66 for Spanish. We make this data available at

                                        <span>  The vulnerability of deep neural networks to imperceptible adversarial
perturbations has attracted widespread attention. Inspired by the success of
vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot
adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text
supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several
issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and
uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these
issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input
sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness
improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially
correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial
examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the
consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal
features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives
access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior
cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot
adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.

that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual
content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video
generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively
extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of
80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components
are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),
which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the
previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk
transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation
module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first
video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a
randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer
autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between
chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In
contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation
when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with
StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that
outperforms competitors with consistency and motion. Our code will be available

whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming
Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both
research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic
and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing
over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of
tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the
historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research
phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of
Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical
transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different
stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from
initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse
array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling
increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our
examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the
emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence,
uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial
influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into
both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside
elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions. An ongoing,

                                        <span>  The construction of large open knowledge bases (OKBs) is integral to many
knowledge-driven applications on the world wide web such as web search.
However, noun phrases and relational phrases in OKBs often suffer from
redundancy and ambiguity, which calls for the investigation on OKB
canonicalization. Current solutions address OKB canonicalization by devising
advanced clustering algorithms and using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to
further facilitate the canonicalization process. Nevertheless, these works fail
to fully exploit the synergy between clustering and KGE learning, and the
methods designed for these subtasks are sub-optimal. To this end, we put
forward a multi-task learning framework, namely MulCanon, to tackle OKB
canonicalization. In addition, diffusion model is used in the soft clustering
process to improve the noun phrase representations with neighboring
information, which can lead to more accurate representations. MulCanon unifies
the learning objectives of these sub-tasks, and adopts a two-stage multi-task
learning paradigm for training. A thorough experimental study on popular OKB
canonicalization benchmarks validates that MulCanon can achieve competitive
canonicalization results.

                                        <span>  Semi-structured tables are ubiquitous. There has been a variety of tasks that
aim to automatically interpret, augment, and query tables. Current methods
often require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, are
restricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions about
tables and tasks. This paper makes the first step towards developing
open-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity of
table-based tasks. Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new dataset
with a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning and
evaluating LLMs. We further develop the first open-source generalist model for
tables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address the
long context challenge. We experiment under both in-domain setting and
out-of-domain setting. On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achieves
comparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite the
latter often has task-specific design. On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves
5-44 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that training
on TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability. We open-source our
dataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalist
models for tables.

learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve
stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for
automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of
standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step
multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.
Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they
invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like
JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we
introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks
involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and
image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide
automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide
a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly
executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies
(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3
types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize
takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on
HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github
(https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms).

                                        <span>  Scaling law principles indicate a power-law correlation between loss and
variables such as model size, dataset size, and computational resources
utilized during training. These principles play a vital role in optimizing
various aspects of model pre-training, ultimately contributing to the success
of large language models such as GPT-4, Llama and Gemini. However, the original
scaling law paper by OpenAI did not disclose the complete details necessary to
derive the precise scaling law formulas, and their conclusions are only based
on models containing up to 1.5 billion parameters. Though some subsequent works
attempt to unveil these details and scale to larger models, they often neglect
the training dependency of important factors such as the learning rate, context
length and batch size, leading to their failure to establish a reliable formula
for predicting the test loss trajectory. In this technical report, we confirm
that the scaling law formulations proposed in the original OpenAI paper remain
valid when scaling the model size up to 33 billion, but the constant
coefficients in these formulas vary significantly with the experiment setup. We
meticulously identify influential factors and provide transparent, step-by-step
instructions to estimate all constant terms in scaling-law formulas by training
on models with only 1M~60M parameters. Using these estimated formulas, we
showcase the capability to accurately predict various attributes for models
with up to 33B parameters before their training, including (1) the minimum
possible test loss; (2) the minimum required training steps and processed
tokens to achieve a specific loss; (3) the critical batch size with an optimal
time/computation trade-off at any loss value; and (4) the complete test loss
trajectory with arbitrary batch size.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) use pretraining to predict the subsequent word;
however, their expansion requires significant computing resources. Numerous big
tech companies and research institutes have developed multilingual LLMs (MLLMs)
to meet current demands, overlooking less-resourced languages (LRLs). This
study proposed three strategies to enhance the performance of LRLs based on the
publicly available MLLMs. First, the MLLM vocabularies of LRLs were expanded to
enhance expressiveness. Second, bilingual data were used for pretraining to
align the high- and less-resourced languages. Third, a high-quality small-scale
instruction dataset was constructed and instruction-tuning was performed to
augment the LRL. The experiments employed the Llama2 model and Korean was used
as the LRL, which was quantitatively evaluated against other developed LLMs
across eight tasks. Furthermore, a qualitative assessment was performed based
on human evaluation and GPT4. Experimental results showed that our proposed
Bllossom model exhibited superior performance in qualitative analyses compared
to previously proposed Korean monolingual models.

                                        <span>  In recent years, significant advancements in pre-trained language models have
driven the creation of numerous non-English language variants, with a
particular emphasis on encoder-only and decoder-only architectures. While
Spanish language models based on BERT and GPT have demonstrated proficiency in
natural language understanding and generation, there remains a noticeable
scarcity of encoder-decoder models explicitly designed for sequence-to-sequence
tasks, which aim to map input sequences to generate output sequences
conditionally. This paper breaks new ground by introducing the implementation
and evaluation of renowned encoder-decoder architectures exclusively
pre-trained on Spanish corpora. Specifically, we present Spanish versions of
BART, T5, and BERT2BERT-style models and subject them to a comprehensive
assessment across various sequence-to-sequence tasks, including summarization,
question answering, split-and-rephrase, dialogue, and translation. Our findings
underscore the competitive performance of all models, with the BART- and
T5-based models emerging as top performers across all tasks. We have made all
models publicly available to the research community to foster future
explorations and advancements in Spanish NLP:

                                        <span>  Prompt tuning for pre-trained masked language models (MLM) has shown
promising performance in natural language processing tasks with few labeled
examples. It tunes a prompt for the downstream task, and a verbalizer is used
to bridge the predicted token and label prediction. Due to the limited training
data, prompt initialization is crucial for prompt tuning. Recently,
MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022) uses meta-learning to learn a shared
initialization for all task-specific prompts. However, a single initialization
is insufficient to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples when the tasks
are complex. Moreover, MetaPrompting requires tuning the whole MLM, causing a
heavy burden on computation and memory as the MLM is usually large. To address
these issues, we use a prompt pool to extract more task knowledge and construct
instance-dependent prompts via attention. We further propose a novel soft
verbalizer (RepVerb) which constructs label embedding from feature embeddings
directly. Combining meta-learning the prompt pool and RepVerb, we propose
MetaPrompter for effective structured prompting. MetaPrompter is
parameter-efficient as only the pool is required to be tuned. Experimental
results demonstrate that MetaPrompter performs better than the recent
state-of-the-arts and RepVerb outperforms existing soft verbalizers.

across application domains, from natural language processing to speech
processing and image understanding. We propose DenseFormer, a simple
modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the
model without increasing its size -- adding a few thousand parameters for
large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an
additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a
weighted average of current and past representations -- we refer to this
operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit
coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured
reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that
DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper
transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models
outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference
time.

nonfactual responses intermittently, which impedes the LLMs' reliability for
further utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel self-detection method to
detect which questions that a LLM does not know that are prone to generate
nonfactual results. Specifically, we first diversify the textual expressions
for a given question and collect the corresponding answers. Then we examine the
divergencies between the generated answers to identify the questions that the
model may generate falsehoods. All of the above steps can be accomplished by
prompting the LLMs themselves without referring to any other external
resources. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on recently released LLMs, e.g., Vicuna, ChatGPT,
and GPT-4.

                                        <span>  Although neural machine translation (NMT) models perform well in the general
domain, it remains rather challenging to control their generation behavior to
satisfy the requirement of different users. Given the expensive training cost
and the data scarcity challenge of learning a new model from scratch for each
user requirement, we propose a memory-augmented adapter to steer pretrained NMT
models in a pluggable manner. Specifically, we construct a multi-granular
memory based on the user-provided text samples and propose a new adapter
architecture to combine the model representations and the retrieved results. We
also propose a training strategy using memory dropout to reduce spurious
dependencies between the NMT model and the memory. We validate our approach on
both style- and domain-specific experiments and the results indicate that our
method can outperform several representative pluggable baselines.

different pre-training tasks, different semantic granularities, and different
model architectures. Few models consider expanding BERT from different text
formats. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge language model
(\textbf{HKLM}), a unified pre-trained language model (PLM) for all forms of
text, including unstructured text, semi-structured text, and well-structured
text. To capture the corresponding relations among these multi-format
knowledge, our approach uses masked language model objective to learn word
knowledge, uses triple classification objective and title matching objective to
learn entity knowledge and topic knowledge respectively. To obtain the
aforementioned multi-format text, we construct a corpus in the tourism domain
and conduct experiments on 5 tourism NLP datasets. The results show that our
approach outperforms the pre-training of plain text using only 1/4 of the data.
We further pre-train the domain-agnostic HKLM and achieve performance gains on
the XNLI dataset.

                                        <span>  Passage reranking is a critical task in various applications, particularly
when dealing with large volumes of documents. Existing neural architectures
have limitations in retrieving the most relevant passage for a given question
because the semantics of the segmented passages are often incomplete, and they
typically match the question to each passage individually, rarely considering
contextual information from other passages that could provide comparative and
reference information. This paper presents a list-context attention mechanism
to augment the passage representation by incorporating the list-context
information from other candidates. The proposed coarse-to-fine (C2F) neural
retriever addresses the out-of-memory limitation of the passage attention
mechanism by dividing the list-context modeling process into two sub-processes
with a cache policy learning algorithm, enabling the efficient encoding of
context information from a large number of candidate answers. This method can
be generally used to encode context information from any number of candidate
answers in one pass. Different from most multi-stage information retrieval
architectures, this model integrates the coarse and fine rankers into the joint
optimization process, allowing for feedback between the two layers to update
the model simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

describes how they can be integrated to provide a model of purposive human
action. Taking seriously the idea of language as action the model is then
applied to the conversational user interfaces. Theory based AI research has had
a hard time recently and the aim here is to revitalise interest in
understanding what LLMs are actually doing other than running poorly understood
machine learning routines over all the data the relevant Big Tech company can
hoover up. When a raspberry pi computer for under 50USD is up to 400 times
faster than the first commercial Cray super computer~\cite{crayVpi}, Big Tech
can get really close to having an infinite number of monkeys typing at random
and producing text, some of which will make sense. By understanding where
ChatGPT's apparent intelligence comes from, perhaps we can perform the magic
with fewer resources and at the same time gain some understanding about our
relationship with our world.

semantic classification at the sentence level to accelerate the process of
corpus building in the field of humanities and linguistics, a traditional and
time-consuming task. We introduce a novel corpus comprising around 2500
sentences spanning from 300 BCE to 900 CE including sexual semantics (medical,
erotica, etc.). We evaluate various sentence classification approaches and
different input embedding layers, and show that all consistently outperform
simple token-based searches. We explore the integration of idiolectal and
sociolectal metadata embeddings (centuries, author, type of writing), but find
that it leads to overfitting. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach, achieving high precision and true positive rates (TPR) of
respectively 70.60% and 86.33% using HAN. We evaluate the impact of the dataset
size on the model performances (420 instead of 2013), and show that, while our
models perform worse, they still offer a high enough precision and TPR, even
without MLM, respectively 69% and 51%. Given the result, we provide an analysis
of the attention mechanism as a supporting added value for humanists in order
to produce more data.

integrating intricate constraints into neural text generation, due to LLMs'
opacity, remains challenging. This study investigates constrained text
generation for LLMs, where predefined constraints are applied during LLM's
generation process. Our research mainly focuses on mainstream open-source LLMs,
categorizing constraints into lexical, structural, and relation-based types. We
also present various benchmarks to facilitate fair evaluation. The study
addresses some key research questions, including evaluating, understanding and

                                        <span>  Entity alignment (EA) seeks identical entities in different knowledge graphs,
which is a long-standing task in the database research. Recent work leverages
deep learning to embed entities in vector space and align them via nearest
neighbor search. Although embedding-based EA has gained marked success in
recent years, it lacks explanations for alignment decisions. In this paper, we
present the first framework that can generate explanations for understanding
and repairing embedding-based EA results. Given an EA pair produced by an
embedding model, we first compare its neighbor entities and relations to build
a matching subgraph as a local explanation. We then construct an alignment
dependency graph to understand the pair from an abstract perspective. Finally,
we repair the pair by resolving three types of alignment conflicts based on
dependency graphs. Experiments on a variety of EA datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our framework in explaining
and repairing embedding-based EA results.

                                        <span>  Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language
models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) in vision scenario. However, existing MLLMs mostly rely
on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for
training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data
redundancy. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical
studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction
datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction
dataset even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a
new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual
instruction data. TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value
of the visual instructions based on computed gradients. Then, according to the
estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual
instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual
instruction subset for training. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our
approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the
full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four
of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released.

                                        <span>  Previous stance detection studies typically concentrate on evaluating stances
within individual instances, thereby exhibiting limitations in effectively
modeling multi-party discussions concerning the same specific topic, as
naturally transpire in authentic social media interactions. This constraint
arises primarily due to the scarcity of datasets that authentically replicate
real social media contexts, hindering the research progress of conversational
stance detection. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-turn conversation
stance detection dataset (called \textbf{MT-CSD}), which encompasses multiple
targets for conversational stance detection. To derive stances from this
challenging dataset, we propose a global-local attention network
(\textbf{GLAN}) to address both long and short-range dependencies inherent in
conversational data. Notably, even state-of-the-art stance detection methods,
exemplified by GLAN, exhibit an accuracy of only 50.47\%, highlighting the
persistent challenges in conversational stance detection. Furthermore, our
MT-CSD dataset serves as a valuable resource to catalyze advancements in
cross-domain stance detection, where a classifier is adapted from a different
yet related target. We believe that MT-CSD will contribute to advancing
real-world applications of stance detection research. Our source code, data,

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
various reasoning tasks. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT
are prone to logical errors during their reasoning processes. Traditional
approaches to mitigate these errors involve human or tool-based feedback, such
as employing task-specific verifiers or aggregating multiple reasoning paths.
These methods, however, either depend heavily on human input or struggle with
inconsistent responses. To overcome these limitations, we present RankPrompt,
an innovative prompting strategy that empowers LLMs to autonomously rank their
responses without needing extra resources. RankPrompt simplifies the ranking
challenge into comparative evaluations among different responses, leveraging
LLMs' innate ability to generate comparative examples within context. Our
experiments across 11 arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks show that
RankPrompt significantly enhances the reasoning performance of ChatGPT and
GPT-4, with improvements of up to 13%. Furthermore, RankPrompt shows
exceptional performance in LLM-based automatic evaluations for open-ended
tasks, matching human judgments 74% of the time in the AlpacaEval dataset. It
also proves to be robust against changes in response order and inconsistency.
Overall, our findings endorse RankPrompt as an effective method for extracting
high-quality feedback directly from language models.

                                        <span>  Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for
tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models
make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes,
facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct
calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in
generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due
to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a
downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However,
evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation
used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by
GLLMs.
  This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for
evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and
classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a
drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS
scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, 6 different GLLMs and 3
different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided,
demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric.
  We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called
SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In 27 out of 35 cases,
SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes
by as much as $18$ percentage points.

expensive. To avoid the prohibitive costs of constantly retraining, it is
imperative to continually train these models. This problem is exacerbated by
the lack of any large scale continual learning benchmarks or baselines. We
introduce the first set of web-scale Time-Continual (TiC) benchmarks for
training vision-language models: TiC-DataComp, TiC-YFCC, and TiC-Redcaps.
TiC-DataComp, our largest dataset, contains over 12.7B timestamped image-text
pairs spanning 9 years (2014-2022). We first use our benchmarks to curate
various dynamic evaluations to measure temporal robustness of existing models.
We show OpenAI's CLIP (trained on data up to 2020) loses $\approx 8\%$
zero-shot accuracy on our curated retrieval task from 2021-2022 compared with
more recently trained models in OpenCLIP repository. We then study how to
efficiently train models on time-continuous data. We demonstrate that a simple
rehearsal-based approach that continues training from the last checkpoint and
replays old data reduces compute by $2.5\times$ when compared to the standard
practice of retraining from scratch. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of
a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs. The side effect of noises
due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning,
but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more
susceptible to limited reference samples with noises. In this paper, we propose
a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model
uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning
representations under Gaussian distribution. Uncertainty representation is
first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after
transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution. Further, to
better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity
features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network
(UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions.
Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the
Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the
optimization. The final completion score for each query instance is measured by
the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the
noises in few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach
achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its
competitors.

conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic
diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly
focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge,
and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in
assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,
the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of
role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of
social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and
covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and
30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations
on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find
that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in
group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the
influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on
RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social
interaction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.

created using machine translation for pre-training language models (LMs).
Pre-training requires vast amounts of monolingual data, which is mostly
unavailable for languages other than English. Recently, there has been a
growing interest in using synthetic data to address this data scarcity. We take
the case of English and Indic languages and translate web-crawled monolingual
documents (clean) into the target language. Then, we train language models
containing 28M and 85M parameters on this translationese data (synthetic). We
show that their performance on downstream natural language understanding and
generative tasks is only 3.56% poorer on NLU tasks and 1.51% on NLG tasks than
LMs pre-trained on clean data. Further, we propose the use of lightweight
TinyLMs pre-trained on clean data to filter synthetic data efficiently which
significantly improves the performance of our models. We also find that LMs
trained on synthetic data strongly benefit from extended pretraining on a tiny
fraction (10%) of clean data. We release the data we collected and created as a
part of this work, IndicMonoDoc, the largest collection of monolingual
document-level corpora, which we hope will help bridge the gap between English
and non-English performance for large language models.

                                        <span>  Instruction tuning is crucial for enabling Language Learning Models (LLMs) in
responding to human instructions. The quality of instruction pairs used for
tuning greatly affects the performance of LLMs. However, the manual creation of
high-quality instruction datasets is costly, leading to the adoption of
automatic generation of instruction pairs by LLMs as a popular alternative. To
ensure the high quality of LLM-generated instruction datasets, several
approaches have been proposed. Nevertheless, existing methods either compromise
dataset integrity by filtering a large proportion of samples, or are unsuitable
for industrial applications. In this paper, instead of discarding low-quality
samples, we propose CoachLM, a novel approach to enhance the quality of
instruction datasets through automatic revisions on samples in the dataset.
CoachLM is trained from the samples revised by human experts and significantly
increases the proportion of high-quality samples in the dataset from 17.7% to
78.9%. The effectiveness of CoachLM is further assessed on various real-world
instruction test sets. The results show that CoachLM improves the
instruction-following capabilities of the instruction-tuned LLM by an average
of 29.9%, which even surpasses larger LLMs with nearly twice the number of
parameters. Furthermore, CoachLM is successfully deployed in a data management
system for LLMs at Huawei, resulting in an efficiency improvement of up to 20%
in the cleaning of 40k real-world instruction pairs. We release various assets
of CoachLM, including the training data, code and test set
(https://github.com/lunyiliu/CoachLM).

opportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining
their parameters. Advances in transfer learning, the process of fine-tuning
pretrained models for specific tasks, has resulted in the development of vast
amounts of task-specific models, typically specialized in individual tasks and
unable to utilize each other's strengths. Model merging facilitates the
creation of multitask models without the need for additional training, offering
a promising avenue for enhancing model performance and versatility. By
preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the original models, model merging
addresses complex challenges in AI - including the difficulties of catastrophic
forgetting and multitask learning. To support this expanding area of research,
we introduce MergeKit, a comprehensive, open-source library designed to
facilitate the application of model merging strategies. MergeKit offers an
extensible framework to efficiently merge models on any hardware, providing
utility to researchers and practitioners. To date, thousands of models have

"hallucinate," resulting in non-factual outputs. Our carefully-designed human
evaluation substantiates the serious hallucination issue, revealing that even
GPT-3.5 produces factual outputs less than 25% of the time. This underscores
the importance of fact verifiers in order to measure and incentivize progress.
Our systematic investigation affirms that LLMs can be repurposed as effective
fact verifiers with strong correlations with human judgments. Surprisingly,
FLAN-T5-11B, the least factual generator in our study, performs the best as a
fact verifier, even outperforming more capable LLMs like GPT3.5 and ChatGPT.
Delving deeper, we analyze the reliance of these LLMs on high-quality evidence,
as well as their deficiencies in robustness and generalization ability. Our
study presents insights for developing trustworthy generation models.

                                        <span>  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread
adoption in various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced
additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact
on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to
develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and
leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns
regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore,
previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display
exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to
certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between
the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the
literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety
measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of
Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still
encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts,
which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs
responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more
pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service
harms for marginalized populations.

severe side effects on users in open-domain dialogue systems. However, research
on detecting NSFW language, especially sexually explicit content, within a
dialogue context has significantly lagged behind. To address this issue, we
introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at NSFW dialogue
detection. Leveraging knowledge distillation techniques involving GPT-4 and
ChatGPT, this dataset offers a cost-effective means of constructing NSFW
content detectors. The process entails collecting real-life human-machine
interaction data and breaking it down into single utterances and single-turn
dialogues, with the chatbot delivering the final utterance. ChatGPT is employed
to annotate unlabeled data, serving as a training set. Rationale validation and
test sets are constructed using ChatGPT and GPT-4 as annotators, with a
self-criticism strategy for resolving discrepancies in labeling. A BERT model
is fine-tuned as a text classifier on pseudo-labeled data, and its performance
is assessed. The study emphasizes the importance of AI systems prioritizing
user safety and well-being in digital conversations while respecting freedom of
expression. The proposed approach not only advances NSFW content detection but
also aligns with evolving user protection needs in AI-driven dialogues.

Conference on Games. The objective of this competition is for participants to
create effective prompts for ChatGPT--enabling it to generate Science Birds
levels with high stability and character-like qualities--fully using their
creativity as well as prompt engineering skills. ChatGPT is a conversational
agent developed by OpenAI. Science Birds is selected as the competition
platform because designing an Angry Birds-like level is not a trivial task due
to the in-game gravity; the quality of the levels is determined by their
stability. To lower the entry barrier to the competition, we limit the task to
the generation of capitalized English alphabetical characters. We also allow
only a single prompt to be used for generating all the characters. Here, the
quality of the generated levels is determined by their stability and similarity
to the given characters. A sample prompt is provided to participants for their
reference. An experiment is conducted to determine the effectiveness of several
modified versions of this sample prompt on level stability and similarity by
testing them on several characters. To the best of our knowledge, we believe
that ChatGPT4PCG is the first competition of its kind and hope to inspire
enthusiasm for prompt engineering in procedural content generation.

                                        <span>  Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated great
zero-shot performance for matching images and text. However, it is still
challenging to adapt vision-lanaguage pretrained models like CLIP to
compositional image and text matching -- a more challenging image and text
matching task requiring the model understanding of compositional word concepts
and visual components. Towards better compositional generalization in zero-shot
image and text matching, in this paper, we study the problem from a causal
perspective: the erroneous semantics of individual entities are essentially
confounders that cause the matching failure. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textbf{\textit{training-free}} compositional CLIP model (ComCLIP). ComCLIP
disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and
composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching
over compositional text embedding and sub-image embeddings. In this way,
ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP
models and dynamically evaluate the importance of each component. Experiments
on four compositional image-text matching datasets: SVO, ComVG, Winoground, and
VL-checklist, and two general image-text retrieval datasets: Flick30K, and
MSCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play method, which boosts
the \textbf{\textit{zero-shot}} inference ability of CLIP, SLIP, and BLIP2 even
without further training or fine-tuning. Our codes can be found at
https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/ComCLIP.

named entity recognition (NER) task has drawn much attention recently. This
work pushes the performance boundary of zero-shot NER with LLMs by proposing a
training-free self-improving framework, which utilizes an unlabeled corpus to
stimulate the self-learning ability of LLMs. First, we use the LLM to make
predictions on the unlabeled corpus using self-consistency and obtain a
self-annotated dataset. Second, we explore various strategies to select
reliable annotations to form a reliable self-annotated dataset. Finally, for
each test input, we retrieve demonstrations from the reliable self-annotated
dataset and perform inference via in-context learning. Experiments on four
benchmarks show substantial performance improvements achieved by our framework.
Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we find that increasing the size
of unlabeled corpus or iterations of self-improving does not guarantee further
improvement, but the performance might be boosted via more advanced strategies
for reliable annotation selection. Code and data are publicly available at

forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find
objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects
(e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar
in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we
propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This
approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant
with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their
interactions$\unicode{x2015}$as well as an extensible backend that can
automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have
implemented and open-sourced VQPy, which has been productized in Cisco as part

infant cries - and the accompanying CryCeleb 2023 task, which is a public
speaker verification challenge based on cry sounds. We released more than 6
hours of manually segmented cry sounds from 786 newborns for academic use,
aiming to encourage research in infant cry analysis. The inaugural public
competition attracted 59 participants, 11 of whom improved the baseline
performance. The top-performing system achieved a significant improvement
scoring 25.8% equal error rate, which is still far from the performance of
state-of-the-art adult speaker verification systems. Therefore, we believe
there is room for further research on this dataset, potentially extending
beyond the verification task.

                                        <span>  The overarching goal of recent AI research has been to make steady progress
towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), prompting the
evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a variety of tasks and
domains. One such domain is healthcare, where LLMs can greatly benefit clinical
practice by assisting with a wide range of tasks. However, these models are
also prone to producing ``hallucinations" or incorrect responses when faced
with queries they cannot adequately address, raising concerns and skepticism,
especially within the healthcare community. In this work, we investigate
whether LLMs understand and can predict medical codes, which are extensively
utilized in healthcare practice. This study aims to delineate the capabilities
and limitations of these LLMs. We evaluate various off-the-shelf LLMs (e.g.,
GPT, LLaMA, etc.) and LLMs specifically designed for biomedical applications to
assess their awareness and understanding of these domain-specific
terminologies. Our results indicate that these models as they currently stand
do not comprehend the meaning of the medical codes, highlighting the need for
better representation of these alphanumeric codes extensively used in
healthcare. We call for improved strategies to effectively capture and
represent the nuances of medical codes and terminologies within LLMs, enabling
them to become more reliable and trustworthy tools for healthcare
professionals.

novel constrained setting. To this end, we create MACGYVER, an automatically
generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately
designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box
thinking. We then present our collection to both LLMs and humans to compare and
contrast their problem-solving abilities. MACGYVER is challenging for both
groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in
tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge,
leading to a higher variance. In contrast, LLMs, exposed to a variety of
specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing
physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of
LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability
with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and
divergent-convergent thinking.
  This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on
intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking,
which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2)
provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both

                                        <span>  Recent chatbots have demonstrated impressive ability to understand and
communicate in raw-text form. However, there is more to the world than raw
text. For example, humans spend long hours of their time on web pages, where
text is intertwined with other modalities and tasks are accomplished in the
form of various complex interactions. Can state-of-the-art multi-modal models
generalize to such complex domains?
  To address this question, we introduce TurkingBench, a benchmark of tasks
formulated as web pages containing textual instructions with multi-modal
context. Unlike existing work which employs artificially synthesized web pages,
here we use natural HTML pages that were originally designed for crowdsourcing
workers for various annotation purposes. The HTML instructions of each task are
also instantiated with various values (obtained from the crowdsourcing tasks)
to form new instances of the task. This benchmark contains 32.2K instances
distributed across 158 tasks.
  Additionally, to facilitate the evaluation on TurkingBench, we develop an
evaluation framework that connects the responses of chatbots to modifications
on web pages (modifying a text box, checking a radio, etc.). We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art models, including language-only, vision-only,
and layout-only models, and their combinations, on this benchmark. Our findings
reveal that these models perform significantly better than random chance, yet
considerable room exists for improvement. We hope this benchmark will help
facilitate the evaluation and development of web-based agents.

pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may
lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more
resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project
examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and
ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a
large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on
28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users
tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply
containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of
quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account.
To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were
randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We
examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media
organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about
politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users
followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more
likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however,
were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested
Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics.
These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and
also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other
computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform
engagement with quality news and public affairs.

safety-fine tuning is ineffective at preventing misuse when model weights are

dual purposes: they act as prompts for synthesizing images through a
text-to-image generator, and as queries for synthesizing text, from which
phrases are extracted using a large language model. Finally, we leverage an
open-vocabulary object detector to generate synthetic bounding boxes for the
synthetic images and texts. We finetune a pretrained vision-and-language model
on this dataset by optimizing a mask-attention consistency objective that
aligns region annotations with gradient-based model explanations. The resulting
model improves the grounding capabilities of an off-the-shelf
vision-and-language model. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game
accuracy of ALBEF on the Flickr30k dataset from 79.38% to 87.26%, and on
RefCOCO+ Test A from 69.35% to 79.06% and on RefCOCO+ Test B from 53.77% to
63.67%.

complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this
study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a
State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data
generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current
Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial
continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight,
we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba,
which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and
memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we
integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate
the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as
FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO
$256\times 256$. Code will be released at https://taohu.me/zigma/

planning problems. Recently, LLMs have been applied in robotics action
planning, particularly using a code generation approach that converts complex
high-level instructions into mid-level policy codes. In contrast, our approach
acquires text descriptions of the task and scene objects, then formulates
action planning through natural language reasoning, and outputs coordinate
level control commands, thus reducing the necessity for intermediate
representation code as policies. Our approach is evaluated on a multi-modal
prompt simulation benchmark, demonstrating that our prompt engineering
experiments with natural language reasoning significantly enhance success rates
compared to its absence. Furthermore, our approach illustrates the potential
for natural language descriptions to transfer robotics skills from known tasks
to previously unseen tasks.

has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is
termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this
issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the entire
internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse
training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available
tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing
the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings,
such as entities. We show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide
superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched
reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks,
helping resolve the reversal curse issue.

                                        <span>  Automatic coding patient behaviors is essential to support decision making
for psychotherapists during the motivational interviewing (MI), a collaborative
communication intervention approach to address psychiatric issues, such as
alcohol and drug addiction. While the behavior coding task has rapidly adapted
machine learning to predict patient states during the MI sessions, lacking of
domain-specific knowledge and overlooking patient-therapist interactions are
major challenges in developing and deploying those models in real practice. To
encounter those challenges, we introduce the Chain-of-Interaction (CoI)
prompting method aiming to contextualize large language models (LLMs) for
psychiatric decision support by the dyadic interactions. The CoI prompting
approach systematically breaks down the coding task into three key reasoning
steps, extract patient engagement, learn therapist question strategies, and
integrates dyadic interactions between patients and therapists. This approach
enables large language models to leverage the coding scheme, patient state, and
domain knowledge for patient behavioral coding. Experiments on real-world
datasets can prove the effectiveness and flexibility of our prompting method
with multiple state-of-the-art LLMs over existing prompting baselines. We have
conducted extensive ablation analysis and demonstrate the critical role of
dyadic interactions in applying LLMs for psychotherapy behavior understanding.

large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning
from them as teacher models. While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such
large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question
of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we
were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more
cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer. We present InfoSumm, a
novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the
information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either
the LLM's capability or human-written references. To achieve this, we first
propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency,
faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the
original document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from
Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization,
then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of
ideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact
but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively
against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities. Extensive
analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models
in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins
over ChatGPT in controllable summarization.

open area of research. Here, we investigate how different tokenization schemes
impact number agreement in Spanish plurals. We find that
morphologically-aligned tokenization performs similarly to other tokenization
schemes, even when induced artificially for words that would not be tokenized
that way during training. We then present exploratory analyses demonstrating
that language model embeddings for different plural tokenizations have similar
distributions along the embedding space axis that maximally distinguishes
singular and plural nouns. Our results suggest that morphologically-aligned
tokenization is a viable tokenization approach, and existing models already
generalize some morphological patterns to new items. However, our results
indicate that morphological tokenization is not strictly required for
performance.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their
outstanding performance in various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks. However, low-resource languages are still lagging behind current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) developments in the field of NLP due to insufficient
resources to train LLMs. Ethiopian languages exhibit remarkable linguistic
diversity, encompassing a wide array of scripts, and are imbued with profound
religious and cultural significance. This paper introduces EthioLLM --
multilingual large language models for five Ethiopian languages (Amharic,
Ge'ez, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya) and English, and Ethiobenchmark -- a
new benchmark dataset for various downstream NLP tasks. We evaluate the
performance of these models across five downstream NLP tasks. We open-source
our multilingual language models, new benchmark datasets for various downstream
tasks, and task-specific fine-tuned language models and discuss the performance
of the models. Our dataset and models are available at the
https://huggingface.co/EthioNLP repository.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present PARAMANU-AYN, a language model based exclusively on
case documents of the Supreme Court of India, the Constitution of India, and
the Indian Penal Code. The novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based model is
pretrained from scratch at a context size of 8192. We evaluated our pretrained
legal model on perplexity metrics. We also instruction-tuned our pretrained
model on a set of 10,763 instructions covering various legal tasks such as
legal reasoning, judgement explanation, legal clause generation, legal
drafting, legal contract drafting, case summarization, constitutional
question-answering, etc. We also evaluated the responses of prompts for
instruction-tuned models by GPT-3.5-Turbo on clarity, relevance, completeness,
and legal reasoning metrics in a scale of 10. Our model can be run on CPU and
achieved 42.46 tokens/sec CPU inference speed. We found that our models,
despite not being pretrained on legal books, various legal contracts, and legal
documents, were able to learn the domain knowledge required for drafting
various legal contracts and legal clauses, and generalize to draft legal
contracts and legal clauses with limited instruction tuning. Hence, we conclude
that for a strong domain-specialized generative language model (such as legal),
very large amounts of data are not required to develop models from scratch. We
believe that this work is the first attempt to make a dedicated generative
legal language model from scratch for Indian Supreme Court jurisdiction or in
legal NLP overall. We plan to release our Paramanu-Ayn model at
https://www.bharatgpts.com.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI
conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic
diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly
focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge,
and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in
assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,
the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of
role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of
social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and
covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and
30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations
on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find
that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in
group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the
influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on
RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social
interaction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.

                                        <span>  This paper shows that text-only Language Models (LM) can learn to ground
spatial relations like "left of" or "below" if they are provided with explicit
location information of objects and they are properly trained to leverage those
locations. We perform experiments on a verbalized version of the Visual Spatial
Reasoning (VSR) dataset, where images are coupled with textual statements which
contain real or fake spatial relations between two objects of the image. We
verbalize the images using an off-the-shelf object detector, adding location
tokens to every object label to represent their bounding boxes in textual form.
Given the small size of VSR, we do not observe any improvement when using
locations, but pretraining the LM over a synthetic dataset automatically
derived by us improves results significantly when using location tokens. We
thus show that locations allow LMs to ground spatial relations, with our
text-only LMs outperforming Vision-and-Language Models and setting the new
state-of-the-art for the VSR dataset. Our analysis show that our text-only LMs
can generalize beyond the relations seen in the synthetic dataset to some
extent, learning also more useful information than that encoded in the spatial
rules we used to create the synthetic dataset itself.

data created using machine translation for pre-training language models (LMs).
Pre-training requires vast amounts of monolingual data, which is mostly
unavailable for languages other than English. Recently, there has been a
growing interest in using synthetic data to address this data scarcity. We take
the case of English and Indic languages and translate web-crawled monolingual
documents (clean) into the target language. Then, we train language models
containing 28M and 85M parameters on this translationese data (synthetic). We
show that their performance on downstream natural language understanding and
generative tasks is only 3.56\% poorer on NLU tasks and 1.51\% on NLG tasks
than LMs pre-trained on clean data. Further, we propose the use of lightweight
\textit{TinyLMs} pre-trained on clean data to filter synthetic data efficiently
which significantly improves the performance of our models. We also find that
LMs trained on synthetic data strongly benefit from extended pretraining on a
tiny fraction (10\%) of clean data. We release the data we collected and
created as a part of this work, \textit{IndicMonoDoc}, the largest collection
of monolingual document-level corpora, which we hope will help bridge the gap
between English and non-English performance for large language models.

line of research beyond the two-party system in the US and audit Llama Chat in
the context of EU politics in various settings to analyze the model's political
knowledge and its ability to reason in context. We adapt, i.e., further
fine-tune, Llama Chat on speeches of individual euro-parties from debates in
the European Parliament to reevaluate its political leaning based on the EUandI
questionnaire. Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties'
positions and is capable of reasoning in context. The adapted, party-specific,
models are substantially re-aligned towards respective positions which we see
as a starting point for using chat-based LLMs as data-driven conversational
engines to assist research in political science.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
capabilities and versatility in NLP tasks, however they sometimes fail to
maintain crucial invariances for specific tasks. One example is permutation
sensitivity, where LLMs' outputs may significantly vary depending on the order
of the input options. While debiasing techniques can mitigate these issues, and
yield better performance and reliability, they often come with a high
computational cost at inference. This paper addresses this inefficiency at
inference time. The aim is to distill the capabilities of a computationally
intensive, debiased, teacher model into a more compact student model. We
explore two variants of student models: one based on pure distillation, and the
other on an error-correction approach for more complex tasks, where the student
corrects a single biased decision from the teacher to achieve a debiased
output. Our approach is general and can be applied to both black-box and
white-box LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our compact, encoder-only
student models can outperform their larger, biased teacher counterparts,
achieving better results with significantly fewer parameters.

                                        <span>  As Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), a popular approach for code
intelligence, continue to grow in size, the computational cost of their usage
has become prohibitively expensive. Prompt learning, a recent development in
the field of natural language processing, emerges as a potential solution to
address this challenge. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
prompt learning in code intelligence tasks. We unveil its reliance on manually
designed prompts, which often require significant human effort and expertise.
Moreover, we discover existing automatic prompt design methods are very limited
to code intelligence tasks due to factors including gradient dependence, high
computational demands, and limited applicability. To effectively address both
issues, we propose Genetic Auto Prompt (GenAP), which utilizes an elaborate
genetic algorithm to automatically design prompts. With GenAP, non-experts can
effortlessly generate superior prompts compared to meticulously manual-designed
ones. GenAP operates without the need for gradients or additional computational
costs, rendering it gradient-free and cost-effective. Moreover, GenAP supports
both understanding and generation types of code intelligence tasks, exhibiting
great applicability. We conduct GenAP on three popular code intelligence PLMs
with three canonical code intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code
summarization, and code translation. The results suggest that GenAP can
effectively automate the process of designing prompts. Specifically, GenAP
outperforms all other methods across all three tasks (e.g., improving accuracy
by an average of 2.13% for defect prediction). To the best of our knowledge,
GenAP is the first work to automatically design prompts for code intelligence
PLMs.

converting natural language descriptions into executable code. However,
generating complex code within real-world scenarios remains challenging due to
intricate structures, subtle bugs, understanding of advanced data types, and
lack of supplementary contents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
CONLINE framework, which enhances code generation by incorporating planned
online searches for information retrieval and automated correctness testing for
iterative refinement. CONLINE also serializes the complex inputs and outputs to
improve comprehension and generate test case to ensure the framework's
adaptability for real-world applications. CONLINE is validated through rigorous
experiments on the DS-1000 and ClassEval datasets. It shows that CONLINE
substantially improves the quality of complex code generation, highlighting its
potential to enhance the practicality and reliability of LLMs in generating
intricate code.

We focus on the task of counselor reflection generation, where we optimize the
generators to simultaneously improve the fluency, coherence, and reflection
quality of generated counselor responses. We introduce two novel bandit
methods, DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt, which rely on the broad strategy of combining
rewards into a single value and optimizing them simultaneously. Specifically,
we employ non-contextual and contextual multi-arm bandits to dynamically adjust
multiple reward weights during training. Through automatic and manual
evaluations, we show that our proposed techniques, DynaOpt and C-DynaOpt,
outperform existing naive and bandit baselines, showcasing their potential for
enhancing language models.

                                        <span>  ORCA (Shen et al., 2023) is a recent technique for cross-modal fine-tuning,
i.e., applying pre-trained transformer models to modalities beyond their
training data. The technique consists primarily of training an embedder and
fine-tuning the embedder and model. Despite its high performance on a variety
of downstream tasks, we do not understand precisely how each of these
components contribute to ORCA's success. Therefore, we run a series of
ablations and find that embedder training does not help 2D tasks at all,
contrary to what the original paper posits. In 1D tasks, some amount of
embedder training is necessary but more is not better. In 4 out of 6 datasets
we experiment with, it is model fine-tuning that makes the biggest difference.
Through our ablations and baselines, we contribute a better understanding of
the individual components of ORCA.

descriptions, where a model should explore the interactions between natural
language instructions and human body movements. While most existing works are
confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions (e.g., "A man squats."),
fine-grained ones specifying movements of relevant body parts are barely
explored. Models trained with coarse texts may not be able to learn mappings
from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives, resulting in the
failure in generating motions from unseen descriptions. In this paper, we build
a large-scale language-motion dataset with fine-grained textual descriptions,
FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with delicate prompts. Accordingly, we
design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, which makes full use of
fine-grained textual information. Our experiments show that FineMotionDiffuse
trained on FineHumanML3D acquires good results in quantitative evaluation. We
also find this model can better generate spatially/chronologically composite
motions by learning the implicit mappings from simple descriptions to the
corresponding basic motions.

                                        <span>  Neural language models, which reach state-of-the-art results on most natural
language processing tasks, are trained on large text corpora that inevitably
contain value-burdened content and often capture undesirable biases, which the
models reflect. This case study focuses on the political biases of pre-trained
encoders in Czech and compares them with a representative value survey. Because
Czech is a gendered language, we also measure how the grammatical gender
coincides with responses to men and women in the survey. We introduce a novel
method for measuring the model's perceived political values. We find that the
models do not assign statement probability following value-driven reasoning,
and there is no systematic difference between feminine and masculine sentences.
We conclude that BERT-sized models do not manifest systematic alignment with
political values and that the biases observed in the models are rather due to
superficial imitation of training data patterns than systematic value beliefs
encoded in the models.

Models (LMMs) in addressing hallucination effects, where models generate
incorrect or unrelated responses. Without additional instruction tuning
paradigm, we introduce Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants
counterfactual thoughts into LMMs using carefully chosen, misaligned
counterfactual keywords. This method is grounded in the concept of
counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where humans consider alternative
realities and outcomes. By applying this human-like reasoning mechanism to
LMMs, we aim to reduce hallucination effects and improve the models'
trustworthiness. We also propose Dual-modality Verification Process (DVP), a
rigorous framework for selecting optimal counterfactual keywords to trigger
counterfactual thinking into LMMs, concurrently considering visual and
linguistic context. Our extensive experiments across various LMMs, including
both open-source and proprietary models, corroborate that our method
significantly mitigates hallucination phenomena across different datasets.

                                        <span>  Currently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can
embed hidden features to texts generated by LLMs to facilitate subsequent
detection, thus alleviating the problem of misuse of LLMs. Although the current
text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its
performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved. In this work,
we proposed that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in
the watermark detection process, that is, the weight of each token should be
adjusted according to its entropy during watermark detection, rather than
setting the weight of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods.
Specifically, we proposed an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) that gives
higher-entropy tokens higher weights during watermark detection, so as to
better reflect the degree of watermarking. Furthermore, the proposed detection
process is training-free and fully automated. %In actual detection, we use a
proxy-LLM to calculate the entropy of each token, without the need to use the
original LLM. In the experiment, we found that our method can achieve better
detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general
and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions. Our code and
data will be available online.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements indicate that scaling up Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) effectively enhances performance on downstream multimodal tasks. The
prevailing MLLM paradigm, \emph{e.g.}, LLaVA, transforms visual features into
text-like tokens using a \emph{static} vision-language mapper, thereby enabling
\emph{static} LLMs to develop the capability to comprehend visual information
through visual instruction tuning. Although promising, the \emph{static} tuning
strategy~\footnote{The static tuning refers to the trained model with static
parameters.} that shares the same parameters may constrain performance across
different downstream multimodal tasks. In light of this, we introduce
HyperLLaVA, which involves adaptive tuning of the projector and LLM parameters,
in conjunction with a dynamic visual expert and language expert, respectively.
These experts are derived from HyperNetworks, which generates adaptive
parameter shifts through visual and language guidance, enabling dynamic
projector and LLM modeling in two-stage training.
  Our experiments demonstrate that our solution significantly surpasses LLaVA
on existing MLLM benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and
LLaVA-Bench. ~\footnote{Our project is available on the link

developed the Agent Group Chat simulation to simulate linguistic interactions
among multi-agent in different settings. Agents are asked to free chat in this
simulation for their own purposes based on their character setting, aiming to
see agents exhibit emergent behaviours that are both unforeseen and
significant. Four narrative scenarios, Inheritance Disputes, Law Court Debates,
Philosophical Discourses, Movie Casting Contention, are integrated into Agent
Group Chat to evaluate its support for diverse storylines. By configuring
specific environmental settings within Agent Group Chat, we are able to assess
whether agents exhibit behaviors that align with human expectations. We
evaluate the disorder within the environment by computing the n-gram Shannon
entropy of all the content speak by characters. Our findings reveal that under
the premise of agents possessing substantial alignment with human expectations,
facilitating more extensive information exchange within the simulation ensures
greater orderliness amidst diversity, which leads to the emergence of more
unexpected and meaningful emergent behaviors. The code is open source in

by Shapley values, to validate the quality of our small training data set and
to ensure the interpretability of model predictions. We demonstrate that a
lightweight, domain-adapted pretrained model, prompted with just 20 shots,
outperforms a traditional classification model by 30.5% accuracy. Our results
serve as a process-oriented guideline for clinical information extraction
projects working with low-resource.

implementation and algorithms, current language models demonstrate remarkable
human-like or surpassing language capabilities. Should computational language
models be employed in studying the brain, and if so, when and how? To delve
into this topic, this paper reviews efforts in using computational models for
brain research, highlighting emerging trends. To ensure a fair comparison, the
paper evaluates various computational models using consistent metrics on the
same dataset. Our analysis reveals that no single model outperforms others on
all datasets, underscoring the need for rich testing datasets and rigid
experimental control to draw robust conclusions in studies involving
computational models.

pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may
lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more
resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project
examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and
ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a
large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on
28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users
tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply
containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of
quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account.
To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were
randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We
examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media
organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about
politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users
followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more
likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however,
were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested
Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics.
These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and
also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other
computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform
engagement with quality news and public affairs.

                                        <span>  User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and
personalized services. Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked
interest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based
user embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As
users continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be
periodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior
patterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack
memory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and
use only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both
cases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we
introduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and
reflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing
by storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior
prediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting
a broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same
User Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether
different segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further
improve the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted
experiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both
static (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically
updated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior
performance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's
effectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior
sequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.

focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on
long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation
system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative
agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging
conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks
performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a
sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that
optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data,
clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and
other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical
professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones
between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to
express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy
and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician
evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S.
licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end
conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the
system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human
nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical
readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct
a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support
agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much
larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class
(LLaMA-2 70B).

due to logical inconsistencies and the inherent difficulty of such reasoning.
We use Lean, a theorem proving framework, to address these challenges. By
formalizing logical reasoning problems into theorems within Lean, we can solve
them by proving or disproving the corresponding theorems. This method reduces
the risk of logical inconsistencies with the help of Lean's symbolic solver. It
also enhances our ability to treat complex reasoning tasks by using Lean's
extensive library of theorem proofs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the FOLIO dataset and achieves performance near this level on
ProofWriter. Notably, these results were accomplished by fine-tuning on fewer
than 100 in-domain samples for each dataset.

                                        <span>  In human-centered design, developing a comprehensive and in-depth
understanding of user experiences, i.e., empathic understanding, is paramount
for designing products that truly meet human needs. Nevertheless, accurately
comprehending the real underlying mental states of a large human population
remains a significant challenge today. This difficulty mainly arises from the
trade-off between depth and scale of user experience research: gaining in-depth
insights from a small group of users does not easily scale to a larger
population, and vice versa. This paper investigates the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for performing mental inference tasks, specifically inferring
users' underlying goals and fundamental psychological needs (FPNs). Baseline
and benchmark datasets were collected from human users and designers to develop
an empathic accuracy metric for measuring the mental inference performance of
LLMs. The empathic accuracy of inferring goals and FPNs of different LLMs with
varied zero-shot prompt engineering techniques are experimented against that of
human designers. Experimental results suggest that LLMs can infer and
understand the underlying goals and FPNs of users with performance comparable
to that of human designers, suggesting a promising avenue for enhancing the
scalability of empathic design approaches through the integration of advanced
artificial intelligence technologies. This work has the potential to
significantly augment the toolkit available to designers during human-centered
design, enabling the development of both large-scale and in-depth understanding
of users' experiences.

agencies to quantify the strengths and issues of a community, allowing them to
allocate their resources better. Such approaches are transitioning towards
leveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and
the assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of
exponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a
gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community
members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap,
we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community
needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language
processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset
about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit,
annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an
utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a
popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our
model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61%
respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations
about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about
assets focus on location and entities. The dataset is available at

Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically, for each
pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank
matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which
is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel freezing
score, we the incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning
to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results
demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average
improvement of up to $0.85\%$ as evaluated on GLUE benchmark while yeilding up
to $9.5\times$ fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of
runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to $1.86\times$ improvement as opposed to similar
PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide
insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules
and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices. Code will be
released.

opportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining
their parameters. Advances in transfer learning, the process of fine-tuning
pre-trained models for specific tasks, has resulted in the development of vast
amounts of task-specific models, typically specialized in individual tasks and
unable to utilize each other's strengths. Model merging facilitates the
creation of multitask models without the need for additional training, offering
a promising avenue for enhancing model performance and versatility. By
preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the original models, model merging
addresses complex challenges in AI - including the difficulties of catastrophic
forgetting and multi-task learning. To support this expanding area of research,
we introduce MergeKit, a comprehensive, open-source library designed to
facilitate the application of model merging strategies. MergeKit offers an
extensible framework to efficiently merge models on any hardware, providing
utility to researchers and practitioners. To date, thousands of models have
been merged by the open-source community, leading to the creation of some of
the worlds most powerful open-source model checkpoints, as assessed by the Open
LLM Leaderboard. The library is accessible at

text based on statistical properties of the text, such as by using occurrence
rates of noncontextual words. In previous work, these techniques have been
used, for example, to determine authorship of all of \emph{The Federalist
Papers}. Such methods may be useful in more modern times to detect fake or AI
authorship. Progress in statistical natural language parsers introduces the
possibility of using grammatical structure to detect authorship. In this paper
we explore a new possibility for detecting authorship using grammatical
structural information extracted using a statistical natural language parser.
This paper provides a proof of concept, testing author classification based on
grammatical structure on a set of "proof texts," The Federalist Papers and
Sanditon which have been as test cases in previous authorship detection
studies. Several features extracted from the statistical natural language
parser were explored: all subtrees of some depth from any level; rooted
subtrees of some depth, part of speech, and part of speech by level in the
parse tree. It was found to be helpful to project the features into a lower
dimensional space. Statistical experiments on these documents demonstrate that
information from a statistical parser can, in fact, assist in distinguishing
authors.

cause severe side effects for users in open-domain dialogue systems. However,
research on detecting pornographic language within human-machine interaction
dialogues is an important subject that is rarely studied. To advance in this
direction, we introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at
detecting whether the dialogue session contains pornographic content. To this
end, we collect real-life human-machine interaction dialogues in the wild and
break them down into single utterances and single-turn dialogues, with the last
utterance spoken by the chatbot. We propose utilizing knowledge distillation of
large language models to annotate the dataset. Specifically, first, the raw
dataset is annotated by four open-source large language models, with the
majority vote determining the label. Second, we use ChatGPT to update the empty
label from the first step. Third, to ensure the quality of the validation and
test sets, we utilize GPT-4 for label calibration. If the current label does
not match the one generated by GPT-4, we employ a self-criticism strategy to
verify its correctness. Finally, to facilitate the detection of pornographic
text, we develop a series of text classifiers using a pseudo-labeled dataset.
Detailed data analysis demonstrates that leveraging knowledge distillation
techniques with large language models provides a practical and cost-efficient
method for developing pornographic text detectors.

                                        <span>  While various models and computational tools have been proposed for structure
and property analysis of molecules, generating molecules that conform to all
desired structures and properties remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a
multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin
to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools,
namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of
text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',
enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions
through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably
performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described
property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an
average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and
61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot
testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have
not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language
styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through
empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG
contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative
approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data
scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains
of drug discovery and materials science. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Cross-lingual summarization (XLS) generates summaries in a language different
from that of the input documents (e.g., English to Spanish), allowing speakers
of the target language to gain a concise view of their content. In the present
day, the predominant approach to this task is to take a performing, pretrained
multilingual language model (LM) and fine-tune it for XLS on the language pairs
of interest. However, the scarcity of fine-tuning samples makes this approach
challenging in some cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose revisiting
the summarize-and-translate pipeline, where the summarization and translation
tasks are performed in a sequence. This approach allows reusing the many,
publicly-available resources for monolingual summarization and translation,
obtaining a very competitive zero-shot performance. In addition, the proposed
pipeline is completely differentiable end-to-end, allowing it to take advantage
of few-shot fine-tuning, where available. Experiments over two contemporary and
widely adopted XLS datasets (CrossSum and WikiLingua) have shown the remarkable
zero-shot performance of the proposed approach, and also its strong few-shot
performance compared to an equivalent multilingual LM baseline, that the
proposed approach has been able to outperform in many languages with only 10%
of the fine-tuning samples.

adoption in various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced
additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact
on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to
develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and
leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns
regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore,
previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display
exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to
certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between
the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the
literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety
measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of
Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still
encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts,
which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs
responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more
pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service
harms for marginalized populations.

opinion to institutional confidence and the political horizon of a state. Fake
News (FN) proliferation on online websites and Online Social Networks (OSNs)
has increased profusely. Various fact-checking websites include news in English
and barely provide information about FN in regional languages. Thus the Urdu FN
purveyors cannot be discerned using factchecking portals. SOTA approaches for
Fake News Detection (FND) count upon appropriately labelled and large datasets.
FND in regional and resource-constrained languages lags due to the lack of
limited-sized datasets and legitimate lexical resources. The previous datasets
for Urdu FND are limited-sized, domain-restricted, publicly unavailable and not
manually verified where the news is translated from English into Urdu. In this
paper, we curate and contribute the first largest publicly available dataset
for Urdu FND, Ax-to-Grind Urdu, to bridge the identified gaps and limitations
of existing Urdu datasets in the literature. It constitutes 10,083 fake and
real news on fifteen domains collected from leading and authentic Urdu
newspapers and news channel websites in Pakistan and India. FN for the
Ax-to-Grind dataset is collected from websites and crowdsourcing. The dataset
contains news items in Urdu from the year 2017 to the year 2023. Expert
journalists annotated the dataset. We benchmark the dataset with an ensemble
model of mBERT,XLNet, and XLM RoBERTa. The selected models are originally
trained on multilingual large corpora. The results of the proposed model are
based on performance metrics, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall and MCC
value.

                                        <span>  Recent studies have demonstrated the emerging capabilities of foundation
models like ChatGPT in several fields, including affective computing. However,
accessing these emerging capabilities is facilitated through prompt
engineering. Despite the existence of some prompting techniques, the field is
still rapidly evolving and many prompting ideas still require investigation. In
this work, we introduce a method to evaluate and investigate the sensitivity of
the performance of foundation models based on different prompts or generation
parameters. We perform our evaluation on ChatGPT within the scope of affective
computing on three major problems, namely sentiment analysis, toxicity
detection, and sarcasm detection. First, we carry out a sensitivity analysis on
pivotal parameters in auto-regressive text generation, specifically the
temperature parameter $T$ and the top-$p$ parameter in Nucleus sampling,
dictating how conservative or creative the model should be during generation.
Furthermore, we explore the efficacy of several prompting ideas, where we
explore how giving different incentives or structures affect the performance.
Our evaluation takes into consideration performance measures on the affective
computing tasks, and the effectiveness of the model to follow the stated
instructions, hence generating easy-to-parse responses to be smoothly used in
downstream applications.

                                        <span>  Sentence embeddings produced by Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have
received wide attention from the NLP community due to their superior
performance when representing texts in numerous downstream applications.
However, the high dimensionality of the sentence embeddings produced by PLMs is
problematic when representing large numbers of sentences in memory- or
compute-constrained devices. As a solution, we evaluate unsupervised
dimensionality reduction methods to reduce the dimensionality of sentence
embeddings produced by PLMs. Our experimental results show that simple methods
such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality of
sentence embeddings by almost $50\%$, without incurring a significant loss in
performance in multiple downstream tasks. Surprisingly, reducing the
dimensionality further improves performance over the original high-dimensional
versions for the sentence embeddings produced by some PLMs in some tasks.

both intrinsic model architecture and dataset.

                                        <span>  When children learn new words, they employ constraints such as the mutual
exclusivity (ME) bias: a novel word is mapped to a novel object rather than a
familiar one. This bias has been studied computationally, but only in models
that use discrete word representations as input, ignoring the high variability
of spoken words. We investigate the ME bias in the context of visually grounded
speech models that learn from natural images and continuous speech audio.
Concretely, we train a model on familiar words and test its ME bias by asking
it to select between a novel and a familiar object when queried with a novel
word. To simulate prior acoustic and visual knowledge, we experiment with
several initialisation strategies using pretrained speech and vision networks.
Our findings reveal the ME bias across the different initialisation approaches,
with a stronger bias in models with more prior (in particular, visual)
knowledge. Additional tests confirm the robustness of our results, even when
different loss functions are considered.

                                        <span>  Open Information Extraction (OIE) is a structured prediction (SP) task in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to extract structured $n$-ary
tuples - usually subject-relation-object triples - from free text. The word
embeddings in the input text can be enhanced with linguistic features, usually
Part-of-Speech (PoS) and Syntactic Dependency Parse (SynDP) labels. However,
past enhancement techniques cannot leverage the power of pretrained language
models (PLMs), which themselves have been hardly used for OIE. To bridge this
gap, we are the first to leverage linguistic features with a Seq2Seq PLM for
OIE. We do so by introducing two methods - Weighted Addition and Linearized
Concatenation. Our work can give any neural OIE architecture the key
performance boost from both PLMs and linguistic features in one go. In our
settings, this shows wide improvements of up to 24.9%, 27.3% and 14.9% on
Precision, Recall and F1 scores respectively over the baseline. Beyond this, we
address other important challenges in the field: to reduce compute overheads
with the features, we are the first ones to exploit Semantic Dependency Parse
(SemDP) tags; to address flaws in current datasets, we create a clean synthetic
dataset; finally, we contribute the first known study of OIE behaviour in SP
models.

has mainly focused on domains such as puns and poetry. In this article, we
present new work on the generation of tongue-twisters - a form of language that
is required to be conditioned on a phoneme level to maximize sound overlap,
whilst maintaining semantic consistency with an input topic and still being
grammatically correct. We present TwisterLister, a pipeline for generating
phonologically informed tongue-twisters from Large Language Models (LLMs) that
we use to generate TwistList 2.0, the largest annotated dataset of
tongue-twisters to date, consisting of 17K+ examples from a combination of
human and LLM authors. Our generation pipeline involves the use of a
phonologically constrained vocabulary alongside LLM prompting to generate
novel, non-derivative tongue-twister examples. We additionally present the
results of automatic and human evaluation of smaller models trained on our
generated dataset to demonstrate the extent to which phonologically motivated
language types can be generated without explicit injection of phonological
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce a Phoneme-Aware Constrained Decoding
module (PACD) that can be integrated into any causal language model and
demonstrate that this method generates good quality tongue-twisters both with
and without fine-tuning the underlying language model. We also design and
implement a range of automatic metrics for the task of tongue-twister
generation that is phonologically motivated and captures the unique essence of
tongue-twisters based on Phonemic Edit Distance (PED).

"hallucination" and show that it stems from an excessive reliance on the
language prior. In particular, we show that as more tokens are generated, the
reliance on the visual prompt decreases, and this behavior strongly correlates
with the emergence of hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations, we introduce
Multi-Modal Mutual-Information Decoding (M3ID), a new sampling method for
prompt amplification. M3ID amplifies the influence of the reference image over
the language prior, hence favoring the generation of tokens with higher mutual
information with the visual prompt. M3ID can be applied to any pre-trained
autoregressive VLM at inference time without necessitating further training and
with minimal computational overhead. If training is an option, we show that
M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the
model's reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels. Our
empirical findings show that our algorithms maintain the fluency and linguistic
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs while reducing hallucinations by mitigating
visually ungrounded answers. Specifically, for the LLaVA 13B model, M3ID and
M3ID+DPO reduce the percentage of hallucinated objects in captioning tasks by
25% and 28%, respectively, and improve the accuracy on VQA benchmarks such as
POPE by 21% and 24%.

                                        <span>  Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning
problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating
finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers
that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice,
transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of
thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of
intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such
intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a
decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of
increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For
instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of
decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard
transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a
slight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under
standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our
results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within
context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm
make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --
the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard
complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for
understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad
impacts its reasoning power.

                                        <span>  Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine
learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve
stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for
automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of
standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step
multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.
Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they
invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like
JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we
introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks
involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and
image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide
automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide
a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly
executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies
(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3
types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize
takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on
HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github
(https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms).

to cater to diverse cultural contexts becomes crucial. Despite advancements in
multilingual capabilities, models are not designed with appropriate cultural
nuances. In this paper, we show that multilingual and Arabic monolingual LMs
exhibit bias towards entities associated with Western culture. We introduce
CAMeL, a novel resource of 628 naturally-occurring prompts and 20,368 entities
spanning eight types that contrast Arab and Western cultures. CAMeL provides a
foundation for measuring cultural biases in LMs through both extrinsic and
intrinsic evaluations. Using CAMeL, we examine the cross-cultural performance
in Arabic of 16 different LMs on tasks such as story generation, NER, and
sentiment analysis, where we find concerning cases of stereotyping and cultural
unfairness. We further test their text-infilling performance, revealing the
incapability of appropriate adaptation to Arab cultural contexts. Finally, we
analyze 6 Arabic pre-training corpora and find that commonly used sources such
as Wikipedia may not be best suited to build culturally aware LMs, if used as
they are without adjustment. We will make CAMeL publicly available at:

impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks. While there are ongoing
efforts to adapt these models to languages beyond English, the attention given
to their evaluation methodologies remains limited. Current multilingual
benchmarks often rely on back translations or re-implementations of English
tests, limiting their capacity to capture unique cultural and linguistic
nuances. To bridge this gap for the Korean language, we introduce the HAE-RAE
Bench, a dataset curated to challenge models lacking Korean cultural and
contextual depth. The dataset encompasses six downstream tasks across four
domains: vocabulary, history, general knowledge, and reading comprehension.
Unlike traditional evaluation suites focused on token and sequence
classification or mathematical and logical reasoning, the HAE-RAE Bench
emphasizes a model's aptitude for recalling Korean-specific knowledge and
cultural contexts. Comparative analysis with prior Korean benchmarks indicates
that the HAE-RAE Bench presents a greater challenge to non-Korean models by
disturbing abilities and knowledge learned from English being transferred.

Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are
present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as
sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However,
these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may
result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages
the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text
diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE
first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire
document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase
representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank
loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us
to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases
and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE
methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a
scientific domain dataset, KP20K.

                                        <span>  Since the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) enhanced
by large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially in popularity.
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task
information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with
understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs
less effective in downstream vision-language tasks. In this paper, we address
the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with Multi-Modal
In-Context Learning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with
multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment
the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal
In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to
understand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICL
achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general
vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and
MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge
of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL
ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language
bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when
faced with extensive textual context. Our code, dataset, dataset tool, and
model are available at https://github.com/PKUnlp-icler/MIC

input text, which benefits human daily life and various downstream tasks.
Recent approaches mainly employ Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to resolve
CTEC. Although PLMs have achieved remarkable success in CTEC, we argue that
previous studies still overlook the importance of human thinking patterns. To
enhance the development of PLMs for CTEC, inspired by humans' daily
error-correcting behavior, we propose a novel model-agnostic progressive
learning framework, named ProTEC, which guides PLMs-based CTEC models to learn
to correct like humans. During the training process, ProTEC guides the model to
learn text error correction by incorporating these sub-tasks into a progressive
paradigm. During the inference process, the model completes these sub-tasks in
turn to generate the correction results. Extensive experiments and detailed
analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
model-agnostic ProTEC framework.

                                        <span>  Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a predominant approach for BERT compression.
Previous KD-based methods focus on designing extra alignment losses for the
student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model. These methods
transfer the knowledge in an indirect way. In this paper, we propose a novel
Weight-Inherited Distillation (WID), which directly transfers knowledge from
the teacher. WID does not require any additional alignment loss and trains a
compact student by inheriting the weights, showing a new perspective of
knowledge distillation. Specifically, we design the row compactors and column
compactors as mappings and then compress the weights via structural
re-parameterization. Experimental results on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show
that WID outperforms previous state-of-the-art KD-based baselines. Further
analysis indicates that WID can also learn the attention patterns from the
teacher model without any alignment loss on attention distributions. The code

jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMa2,
diverging from traditional robustness-focused binary evaluations. Our study
introduces two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and
a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework, using a scoring range from 0 to 1,
offers a unique perspective, enabling a more comprehensive and nuanced
evaluation of attack effectiveness and empowering attackers to refine their
attack prompts with greater understanding. Furthermore, we have developed a
comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak tasks.
This dataset not only serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study but
also establishes a foundational resource for future research, enabling
consistent and comparative analyses in this evolving field. Upon meticulous
comparison with traditional evaluation methods, we discovered that our
evaluation aligns with the baseline's trend while offering a more profound and
detailed assessment. We believe that by accurately evaluating the effectiveness
of attack prompts in the Jailbreak task, our work lays a solid foundation for
assessing a wider array of similar or even more complex tasks in the realm of
prompt injection, potentially revolutionizing this field.

generating hallucinated information. Such inaccurate outputs not only undermine
the reliability of these models but also limit their use and raise serious
concerns about misinformation and propaganda. In this work, we focus on
hallucinated book and article references and present them as the "model
organism" of language model hallucination research, due to their frequent and
easy-to-discern nature. We posit that if a language model cites a particular
reference in its output, then it should ideally possess sufficient information
about its authors and content, among other relevant details. Using this basic
insight, we illustrate that one can identify hallucinated references without
ever consulting any external resources, by asking a set of direct or indirect
queries to the language model about the references. These queries can be
considered as "consistency checks." Our findings highlight that while LMs,
including GPT-4, often produce inconsistent author lists for hallucinated
references, they also often accurately recall the authors of real references.
In this sense, the LM can be said to "know" when it is hallucinating
references. Furthermore, these findings show how hallucinated references can be
dissected to shed light on their nature. Replication code and results can be

                                        <span>  Detectives frequently engage in information detection and reasoning
simultaneously when making decisions across various cases, especially when
confronted with a vast amount of information. With the rapid development of
large language models~(LLMs), evaluating how these models identify key
information and reason to solve questions becomes increasingly relevant. We
introduces the DetectBench, a reading comprehension dataset designed to assess
a model's ability to jointly ability in key information detection and multi-hop
reasoning when facing complex and implicit information. The DetectBench
comprises 3,928 questions, each paired with a paragraph averaging 190 tokens in
length. To enhance model's detective skills, we propose the Detective Thinking
Framework. These methods encourage models to identify all possible clues within
the context before reasoning. Our experiments reveal that existing models
perform poorly in both information detection and multi-hop reasoning. However,
the Detective Thinking Framework approach alleviates this issue.

                                        <span>  Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) has attracted growing attention in
recent years as a result of the advancement and implementation of
human-computer interface technologies. In this paper, we propose an emotional
inertia and contagion-driven dependency modeling approach (EmotionIC) for ERC
task. Our EmotionIC consists of three main components, i.e., Identity Masked
Multi-Head Attention (IMMHA), Dialogue-based Gated Recurrent Unit (DiaGRU), and
Skip-chain Conditional Random Field (SkipCRF). Compared to previous ERC models,
EmotionIC can model a conversation more thoroughly at both the
feature-extraction and classification levels. The proposed model attempts to
integrate the advantages of attention- and recurrence-based methods at the
feature-extraction level. Specifically, IMMHA is applied to capture
identity-based global contextual dependencies, while DiaGRU is utilized to
extract speaker- and temporal-aware local contextual information. At the
classification level, SkipCRF can explicitly mine complex emotional flows from
higher-order neighboring utterances in the conversation. Experimental results
show that our method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models
on four benchmark datasets. The ablation studies confirm that our modules can
effectively model emotional inertia and contagion.

electronic health records (EHRs) typically relies on expert opinion for feature
selection and adjusting observation window size. This burdens experts and
creates a bottleneck in the development process. We propose Retrieval-Enhanced
Medical prediction model (REMed) to address such challenges. REMed can
essentially evaluate an unlimited number of clinical events, select the
relevant ones, and make predictions. This approach effectively eliminates the
need for manual feature selection and enables an unrestricted observation
window. We verified these properties through experiments on 27 clinical tasks
and two independent cohorts from publicly available EHR datasets, where REMed
outperformed other contemporary architectures that aim to handle as many events
as possible. Notably, we found that the preferences of REMed align closely with
those of medical experts. We expect our approach to significantly expedite the
development of EHR prediction models by minimizing clinicians' need for manual
involvement.

focused on training a robust sentiment identifier for parliamentary
proceedings. The paper additionally introduces the first domain-specific
multilingual transformer language model for political science applications,
which was additionally pre-trained on 1.72 billion words from parliamentary
proceedings of 27 European parliaments. We present experiments demonstrating
how the additional pre-training on parliamentary data can significantly improve
the model downstream performance, in our case, sentiment identification in
parliamentary proceedings. We further show that our multilingual model performs
very well on languages not seen during fine-tuning, and that additional
fine-tuning data from other languages significantly improves the target
parliament's results. The paper makes an important contribution to multiple
disciplines inside the social sciences, and bridges them with computer science
and computational linguistics. Lastly, the resulting fine-tuned language model
sets up a more robust approach to sentiment analysis of political texts across
languages, which allows scholars to study political sentiment from a
comparative perspective using standardized tools and techniques.

robust Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework.
This framework is crucial for integrating structured knowledge into multi-modal
Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale, aiming to alleviate issues like
knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, to
evaluate models' ability to accurately embed entities within MMKGs, we focus on
two widely researched tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and
Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a
novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with
modality-level noise masking for the robust integration of multi-modal entity
features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC
and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets
(three for MKGC and seven for MEMA), demonstrating its robustness and
versatility. Besides, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also
enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements. Our

  The shared task was tackled by a total of 58 different users grouped in 42
teams, out of which 27 elected to write a system description paper;
collectively, they submitted over 300 prediction sets on both tracks of the
shared task. We observe a number of key trends in how this approach was tackled
-- many participants rely on a handful of model, and often rely either on
synthetic data for fine-tuning or zero-shot prompting strategies. While a
majority of the teams did outperform our proposed baseline system, the
performances of top-scoring systems are still consistent with a random handling
of the more challenging items.

pre-trained language models (PLMs), prompt-tuning aims to reduce the gap
between downstream tasks and pre-training objectives. While prompt-tuning has
yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still
remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to
specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we
disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the
over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in PLMs and the abridged
knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that PLMs
mis-locate the knowledge distributions corresponding to the target domains in
the universal knowledge embedding space. To this end, we intuitively explore to
approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased
manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts,
thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for PLMs. Guided by such an
intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely BayesPrompt, to
learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the
interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. BayesPrompt primitively
leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions
of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features
from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for PLMs.
We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

processing tasks, their huge size and the inaccessibility of parameters present
challenges for practical deployment. Previous studies try to distill
task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and
chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains
faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in
reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation
(PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled
data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In
PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated
error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further
training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the
reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step
verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains. We evaluate PaD on arithmetic
reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and general ability. Experimental results
demonstrate that smaller models using PaD can not only outperform certain
LLMs~(e.g., LLaMA-1 13B) but also achieve strong improvement over baselines
with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data. The source code is

interest, but achieving effective control over format and content
simultaneously remains challenging. Traditional systems usually accept keywords
as user inputs, resulting in limited control over content. Large language
models (LLMs) improve content control by allowing unrestricted user
instructions, but the token-by-token generation process frequently makes format
errors. Motivated by this, we propose CharPoet, a Chinese classical poetry
generation system based on token-free LLM, which provides effective control
over both format and content. Our token-free architecture generates in a
character-by-character manner, enabling precise control over the number of
characters. Pruned from existing token-based LLMs, CharPoet inherits their
pretrained capabilities and can generate poetry following instructions like
"Write me a poem for my mother's birthday." CharPoet achieves format accuracy
above 0.96, outperforming Jiuge-GPT-2 (0.91) and GPT-4 (0.38). In terms of
content quality, CharPoet surpasses traditional systems including Jiuge, and is
comparable to other LLMs. Our system is open source and available at

CharPoet is available at https://youtu.be/voZ25qEp3Dc.

across diverse tasks, recent studies showcase that causal LLMs suffer from the
"reversal curse". It is a typical example that the model knows "A's father is
B", but is unable to reason "B's child is A". This limitation poses a challenge
to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a
gap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In
this paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root
cause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the
training and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language
models to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,
permutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since
this can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous
permutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing
challenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address
this issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which
addresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units
(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting
these units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on
reversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly
advances the performance of existing works.

                                        <span>  Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have garnered
significant research attention. However, fully harnessing the potential of LLMs
for agent-based tasks presents inherent challenges due to the heterogeneous
nature of diverse data sources featuring multi-turn trajectories. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{AgentOhana} as a comprehensive solution to address
these challenges. \textit{AgentOhana} aggregates agent trajectories from
distinct environments, spanning a wide array of scenarios. It meticulously
standardizes and unifies these trajectories into a consistent format,
streamlining the creation of a generic data loader optimized for agent
training. Leveraging the data unification, our training pipeline maintains
equilibrium across different data sources and preserves independent randomness
across devices during dataset partitioning and model training. Additionally, we
present \textbf{xLAM-v0.1}, a large action model tailored for AI agents, which
demonstrates exceptional performance across various benchmarks. Begin the

                                        <span>  Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate
text with supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the
answer and makes the LLM's output more reliable. Retrieval plays a crucial role
in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only
supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve
as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the
widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit
the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since
they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have
not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does
not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the
correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose \LLatrieval (Large Language
Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it
verifies that the retrieved documents can sufficiently support answering the
question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and
facilitate the retrieval result to fully support verifiable generation.
Experiments show that LLatrieval significantly outperforms extensive baselines
and achieves state-of-the-art results.

                                        <span>  Entity Linking (EL) is a fundamental task for Information Extraction and
Knowledge Graphs. The general form of EL (i.e., end-to-end EL) aims to first
find mentions in the given input document and then link the mentions to
corresponding entities in a specific knowledge base. Recently, the paradigm of
retriever-reader promotes the progress of end-to-end EL, benefiting from the
advantages of dense entity retrieval and machine reading comprehension.
However, the existing study only trains the retriever and the reader separately
in a pipeline manner, which ignores the benefit that the interaction between
the retriever and the reader can bring to the task. To advance the
retriever-reader paradigm to perform more perfectly on end-to-end EL, we
propose BEER$^2$, a Bidirectional End-to-End training framework for Retriever
and Reader. Through our designed bidirectional end-to-end training, BEER$^2$
guides the retriever and the reader to learn from each other, make progress
together, and ultimately improve EL performance. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks of multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
BEER$^2$.

                                        <span>  Disease name normalization is an important task in the medical domain. It
classifies disease names written in various formats into standardized names,
serving as a fundamental component in smart healthcare systems for various
disease-related functions. Nevertheless, the most significant obstacle to
existing disease name normalization systems is the severe shortage of training
data. While data augmentation is a powerful approach for addressing data
scarcity, our findings reveal that conventional data augmentation techniques
often impede task performance, primarily due to the multi-axis and
multi-granularity nature of disease names. Consequently, we introduce a set of
customized data augmentation techniques designed to leverage the semantic
information inherent in disease names. These techniques aim to enhance the
model's understanding of the semantic intricacies and classification structure
of disease names. Through extensive experimentation, we illustrate that our
proposed plug-and-play methods not only surpass general data augmentation
techniques but also exhibit significant performance improvements across various
baseline models and training objectives, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. This underscores its potential for widespread application in
medical language processing tasks.

                                        <span>  In recent years, progress in NLU has been driven by benchmarks. These
benchmarks are typically collected by crowdsourcing, where annotators write
examples based on annotation instructions crafted by dataset creators. In this
work, we hypothesize that annotators pick up on patterns in the crowdsourcing
instructions, which bias them to write many similar examples that are then
over-represented in the collected data. We study this form of bias, termed
instruction bias, in 14 recent NLU benchmarks, showing that instruction
examples often exhibit concrete patterns, which are propagated by crowdworkers
to the collected data. This extends previous work (Geva et al., 2019) and
raises a new concern of whether we are modeling the dataset creator's
instructions, rather than the task. Through a series of experiments, we show
that, indeed, instruction bias can lead to overestimation of model performance,
and that models struggle to generalize beyond biases originating in the
crowdsourcing instructions. We further analyze the influence of instruction
bias in terms of pattern frequency and model size, and derive concrete
recommendations for creating future NLU benchmarks.

unsupervised sentence representation. As an essential element, data
augmentation protocols, however, have not been well explored. The pioneering
work SimCSE resorting to a simple dropout mechanism (viewed as continuous
augmentation) surprisingly dominates discrete augmentations such as cropping,
word deletion, and synonym replacement as reported. To understand the
underlying rationales, we revisit existing approaches and attempt to
hypothesize the desiderata of reasonable data augmentation methods: balance of
semantic consistency and expression diversity. We then develop three simple yet
effective discrete sentence augmentation schemes: punctuation insertion, modal
verbs, and double negation. They act as minimal noises at lexical level to
produce diverse forms of sentences. Furthermore, standard negation is
capitalized on to generate negative samples for alleviating feature suppression
involved in contrastive learning. We experimented extensively with semantic
textual similarity on diverse datasets. The results support the superiority of
the proposed methods consistently.

automatic speech recognition (ASR) models released by OpenAI. A novel
speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time
adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small
number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level
adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to
isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be
achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average
32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can
be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the
average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using
speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved
considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also
provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and
dialect-specific lexical nuances.

                                        <span>  Multimodal intent recognition poses significant challenges, requiring the
incorporation of non-verbal modalities from real-world contexts to enhance the
comprehension of human intentions. Existing benchmark datasets are limited in
scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise
in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec2.0, a
large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party
conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated
within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope
samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn
contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we
provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching
its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general
framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue
data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope
classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built
using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While
existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements,
effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples
remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a
significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of
machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe
that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering
foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and
significantly facilitating related applications. The full dataset and codes are

                                        <span>  Recent language models generate false but plausible-sounding text with
surprising frequency. Such "hallucinations" are an obstacle to the usability of
language-based AI systems and can harm people who rely upon their outputs. This
work shows that there is an inherent statistical lower-bound on the rate that
pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having nothing
to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For "arbitrary"
facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that
hallucinations must occur at a certain rate for language models that satisfy a
statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models.
Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that
the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts
that occur exactly once in the training data (a "Good-Turing" estimate), even
assuming ideal training data without errors.
  One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors
(i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the
type of arbitrary facts that tend to appear once in the training set. However,
our analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining
will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the
training data (like references to publications such as articles and books,
whose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on
systematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different
architectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of
hallucinations.

unimodal aggregation (UMA) is proposed to segment and integrate the feature
frames that belong to the same text token, and thus to learn better feature
representations for text tokens. The frame-wise features and weights are both
derived from an encoder. Then, the feature frames with unimodal weights are
integrated and further processed by a decoder. Connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) loss is applied for training. Compared to the regular CTC,
the proposed method learns better feature representations and shortens the
sequence length, resulting in lower recognition error and computational
complexity. Experiments on three Mandarin datasets show that UMA demonstrates
superior or comparable performance to other advanced non-autoregressive
methods, such as self-conditioned CTC. Moreover, by integrating
self-conditioned CTC into the proposed framework, the performance can be
further noticeably improved.

help clients facilitate exploration, gain insight, take action, and ultimately
heal themselves. A practical and user-friendly dialogue system should be
client-centric, focusing on the client's behaviors. However, existing dialogue
systems publicly available for mental health support often concentrate solely
on the counselor's strategies rather than the behaviors expressed by clients.
This can lead to unreasonable or inappropriate counseling strategies and
corresponding responses generated by the dialogue system. To address this
issue, we propose PsyChat, a client-centric dialogue system that provides
psychological support through online chat. The client-centric dialogue system
comprises five modules: client behavior recognition, counselor strategy
selection, input packer, response generator, and response selection. Both
automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of our proposed dialogue system for real-life mental health support.
Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that the dialogue system can predict
the client's behaviors, select appropriate counselor strategies, and generate
accurate and suitable responses.

                                        <span>  Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is the task of mapping mentions with
multimodal contexts to the referent entities from a knowledge base. Existing
MEL methods mainly focus on designing complex multimodal interaction mechanisms
and require fine-tuning all model parameters, which can be prohibitively costly
and difficult to scale in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this
work, we propose GEMEL, a Generative Multimodal Entity Linking framework based
on LLMs, which directly generates target entity names. We keep the vision and
language model frozen and only train a feature mapper to enable cross-modality
interactions. To adapt LLMs to the MEL task, we leverage the in-context
learning capability of LLMs by retrieving multimodal instances as
demonstrations. Extensive experiments show that, with only ~0.3% of the model
parameters fine-tuned, GEMEL achieves state-of-the-art results on two
well-established MEL datasets (7.7% accuracy gains on WikiDiverse and 8.8%
accuracy gains on WikiMEL). The performance gain stems from mitigating the
popularity bias of LLM predictions and disambiguating less common entities
effectively. Further analysis verifies the generality and scalability of GEMEL.
Our framework is compatible with any off-the-shelf language model, paving the
way towards an efficient and general solution for utilizing LLMs in the MEL
task. Our code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/GEMEL.

                                        <span>  We show the viability of tackling misuses of large language models beyond the
identification of machine-generated text. While existing zero-bit watermark
methods focus on detection only, some malicious misuses demand tracing the
adversary user for counteracting them. To address this, we propose Multi-bit
Watermark via Position Allocation, embedding traceable multi-bit information
during language model generation. Through allocating tokens onto different
parts of the messages, we embed longer messages in high corruption settings
without added latency. By independently embedding sub-units of messages, the
proposed method outperforms the existing works in terms of robustness and
latency. Leveraging the benefits of zero-bit watermarking, our method enables
robust extraction of the watermark without any model access, embedding and
extraction of long messages ($\geq$ 32-bit) without finetuning, and maintaining
text quality, while allowing zero-bit detection all at the same time. Code is

inference: explicit controllable text generation. Multi-modal LLMs empower
multi-modality understanding with the capability of semantic generation yet
bring less explainability and heavier reliance on prompt contents due to their
autoregressive generative nature. While manipulating prompt formats could
improve outputs, designing specific and precise prompts per task can be
challenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel
inference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific
prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by
the classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional
context pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the
autoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.
Notably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted
tokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Our
approach is compatible with current LLMs and VLMs, achieving impressive
customized generation results without training. Experiments confirm its
effectiveness in focusing on input contexts and generating reliable content.
Without tuning on LLaVA-v1.5, our method secured 70.7 in the MMBench test and
1552.5 in MME-perception. The code is available at:

motivate the development and utilization of such large models in biomedicine.
However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there
are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be
used in real-world applications. Frontier models such as GPT-4V still have
major competency gaps in multimodal capabilities for biomedical applications.
Moreover, pragmatic issues such as access, cost, latency, and compliance make
it hard for clinicians to use privately-hosted state-of-the-art large models
directly on private patient data. In this paper, we explore training
open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge biomedical competency gaps
for unmet clinical needs. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular
approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and
text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each
modality to the text embedding space. We conduct a comprehensive study of this
approach on radiology imaging. For training, we assemble a large dataset with
over 1 million image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose a clinically driven
novel approach using GPT-4 and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation.
We also study grounding qualitatively using attention. For best practice, we
conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and
multimodal training. The resulting LLaVA-Rad (7B) model attains
state-of-the-art results on radiology tasks such as report generation and
cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and
Med-PaLM M (84B). LLaVA-Rad is fast and can be run on a single V100 GPU in
private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world
clinical applications.

and decision-making tools that are created through extensive alignment with
human feedback. However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that
should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead
us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them.
Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability
issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2)
stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate
prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to
detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we
intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can
automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce
AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can
automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed
hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN
not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but
also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and
cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare
AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass
them effectively.

and agents. Examining real-life applications benefit learning practical ethics
in many situations, offering valuable data to grasp the complexities of human
ethics in diverse contexts. In this paper, we examine social media platforms
for understanding real-life ethical scenarios and human moral judgments. We
examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called
r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on
who is blameworthy. We employ computational techniques to investigate the
underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments. We focus on excerpts-which we
term moral sparks-from original posts that commenters include to indicate what
motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating
social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect moral sparks assignment
and their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24 672 posts and 175988
comments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature
and rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent
relationship between character traits and moral values. Specially, we focus on
causal graph involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We
observe that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness,
influencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This
observation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing
semantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters'
cognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral
spark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social
simulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena with LLM-based
agents. However, most work has used an omniscient perspective on these
simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is
fundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric
interactions that humans have. To examine these differences, we develop an
evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various
settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors
simulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals
compared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic
setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations
improves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal
achievement in cooperative scenarios. Our findings indicate that addressing
information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.

                                        <span>  In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in
task-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design.
Recent advancements in prompting have enhanced reasoning in logic-intensive
tasks for LLMs, yet the nuanced understanding abilities of these models,
crucial for processing and interpreting complex information, remain
underexplored. In this study, we introduce Metacognitive Prompting (MP), a
strategy inspired by human introspective reasoning processes. Using MP, LLMs
undergo a systematic series of structured, self-aware evaluations, drawing on
both their vast inherent knowledge and new insights. We conduct extensive
experiments on four prevalent LLMs: Llama2, PaLM2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, across
ten natural language understanding (NLU) datasets from GLUE, SuperGLUE, BLUE,
and LexGLUE benchmarks. Additionally, we compare our method with
chain-of-thought prompting and its advanced versions. The results show that
GPT-4 consistently excels across all tasks, while other models have shown
significant progress in some tasks when used in conjunction with MP.
Furthermore, MP consistently outperforms existing prompting methods in both
general and domain-specific NLU tasks. This study underscores the potential to
amplify the understanding abilities of LLMs and highlights the benefits of
mirroring human introspective reasoning in NLU tasks.

to achieve the highest performance on large corpora of available textual data.
However, the sheer size of the Transformer architectures makes it difficult to
deploy models within computational, environmental or device-specific
constraints. We explore data-driven compression of existing pretrained models
as an alternative to training smaller models from scratch. To do so, we scale
Kronecker-factored curvature approximations of the target loss landscape to
large language models. In doing so, we can compute both the dynamic allocation
of structures that can be removed as well as updates of remaining weights that
account for the removal. We provide a general framework for unstructured,
semi-structured and structured pruning and improve upon weight updates to
capture more correlations between weights, while remaining computationally
efficient. Experimentally, our method can prune rows and columns from a range
of OPT models and Llamav2-7B by 20%-30%, with a negligible loss in performance,
and achieve state-of-the-art results in unstructured and semi-structured
pruning of large language models.

the issue from the perspective of claim/rumour verification. We propose the
first logical reasoning framework designed to break down any claim or rumour
paired with evidence into the atomic reasoning steps necessary for
verification. Based on our framework, we curate two annotated collections of
such claim/evidence pairs: a synthetic dataset from Wikipedia and a real-world
set stemming from rumours circulating on Twitter. We use them to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 (hereinafter referred to as
ChatGPT) within the context of our framework, providing a thorough analysis.
Our results show that ChatGPT struggles in abductive reasoning, although this
can be somewhat mitigated by using manual Chain of Thought (CoT) as opposed to
Zero-Shot (ZS) and ZS CoT approaches. Our study contributes to the growing body
of research suggesting that ChatGPT's reasoning processes are unlikely to
mirror human-like reasoning, and that LLMs need to be more rigorously evaluated
to distinguish between hype and actual capabilities, especially in high-stakes
real-world tasks such as claim verification.

problem. Event pairs are situated within a discourse at different distances,
which we refer to as proximity bands. The temporal ordering communicated about
event pairs situated at more remote (i.e., ``long'') or less remote (i.e.,
``short'') proximity bands is encoded differently. SOTA ETRE models have tended
to perform well on events situated at either short or long proximity bands, but
not both. Yet, real-world, natural texts contain all types of temporal
event-pairs. In this paper, we present MulCo: Multi-Scale Contrastive Knowledge
Co-Distillation, a fusion approach that shares knowledge across multiple event
pair proximity bands in order to improve performance on all types of temporal
datasets. Our experimental results show that MulCo successfully integrates
linguistic cues pertaining to temporal reasoning across both short and long
proximity bands and achieves new state-of-the-art results on several ETRE
benchmark datasets.

system and reduces the quality and intelligibility of a person's speech.
Because of this effect, the normal speech processing systems can not work
properly on impaired speech. This disability is usually associated with
physical disabilities. Therefore, designing a system that can perform some
tasks by receiving voice commands in the smart home can be a significant
achievement. In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to
represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for
the convolutional neural network. On the other word, we convert each speech
file into an image and propose image recognition system to classify speech in
different scenarios. Proposed CNN is based on the transfer learning method on
the pre-trained Alexnet. In this research, the efficiency of the proposed
system for speech recognition, speaker identification, and intelligibility
assessment is evaluated. According to the results on the UA dataset, the
proposed speech recognition system achieved 91.29% accuracy in
speaker-dependent mode, the speaker identification system acquired 87.74%
accuracy in text-dependent mode, and the intelligibility assessment system
achieved 96.47% accuracy in two-class mode. Finally, we propose a multi-network
speech recognition system that works fully automatically. This system is
located in a cascade arrangement with the two-class intelligibility assessment
system, and the output of this system activates each one of the speech
recognition networks. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 92.3% WRR. The

                                        <span>  The capability of intelligent models to extrapolate and comprehend changes in
object states is a crucial yet demanding aspect of AI research, particularly
through the lens of human interaction in real-world settings. This task
involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects,
and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional
methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a
limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of
symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the
language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object
State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark.
OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique
objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for
evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments
demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of
object state changes. The benchmark includes a fine-tuned model that, despite
initial capabilities, requires significant improvements in accuracy and
generalization ability for effective understanding of these changes. Our code
and dataset are available at https://github.com/nguyennm1024/OSCaR.
