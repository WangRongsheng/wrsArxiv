However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,\nthe first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of\nrole-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of\nsocial interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and\ncovers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and\n30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations\non this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find\nthat agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in\ngroup level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the\ninfluence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on\nRoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social\ninteraction of role-playing conversational agents.

It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model.

Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors.

However,\nour analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining\nwill lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the\ntraining data (like references to publications such as articles and books,\nwhose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on\nsystematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different\narchitectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of\nhallucinations.\n","authors":["Adam Tauman Kalai","Santosh S.

To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of\ntext-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',\nenabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions\nthrough various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably\nperforms in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described\nproperty requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an\naverage molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and\n61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot\ntesting, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have\nnot been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language\nstyles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through\nempirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG\ncontributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative\napproach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data\nscarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains\nof drug discovery and materials science.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel\ninference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific\nprompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by\nthe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional\ncontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the\nautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.\nNotably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted\ntokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs.

The Misleading Success of\n  Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs","summary":"  Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social\nsimulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena with LLM-based\nagents. However, most work has used an omniscient perspective on these\nsimulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is\nfundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric\ninteractions that humans have. To examine these differences, we develop an\nevaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various\nsettings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors\nsimulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals\ncompared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic\nsetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations\nimproves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal\nachievement in cooperative scenarios.

LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors,\nincluding humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors.\nCollectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic\ntokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these\norchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching\nin semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct\nparallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves\ncrafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for\nextracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the\nsemantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective\non the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much\ngreater complexity and capabilities.

Prior research has typically tackled the issue of bias\nthrough a one-dimensional perspective, concentrating either on locating or\nmitigating it. This limited perspective has created obstacles in facilitating\nresearch on bias to synergistically complement and progressively build upon one\nanother. In this study, we integrate the processes of locating and mitigating\nbias within a unified framework.

However, TRIZ is a heuristic based on a\nhistoric patent analysis and does not make use of the ever-increasing number of\nlatest technological solutions in current patents. Because of the huge number\nof patents, their length, and, last but not least, their complexity there is a\nneed for modern patent retrieval and patent analysis to go beyond\nkeyword-oriented methods. Recent advances in patent retrieval and analysis\nmainly focus on dense vectors based on neural AI Transformer language models\nlike Google BERT. They are, for example, used for dense retrieval, question\nanswering or summarization and key concept extraction. A research focus within\nthe methods for patent summarization and key concept extraction are generic\ninventive concepts respectively TRIZ concepts like problems, solutions,\nadvantage of invention, parameters, and contradictions. Succeeding rule-based\napproaches, finetuned BERT-like language models for sentence-wise\nclassification represent the state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction.\nWhile they work comparatively well for basic concepts like problems or\nsolutions, contradictions - as a more complex abstraction - remain a challenge\nfor these models. This paper goes one step further, as it presents a method to\nextract TRIZ contradictions from patent texts based on Prompt Engineering using\na generative Large Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI's GPT-4. Contradiction\ndetection, sentence extraction, contradiction summarization, parameter\nextraction and assignment to the 39 abstract TRIZ engineering parameters are\nall performed in a single prompt using the LangChain framework.

To address that, we propose MMIDR, a\nframework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual\nexplanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To\nconvert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following\nformat, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline\nconsists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval\nmodule. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to\nextract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal\nmisinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation\napproach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal\nmisinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions\nregarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks,\nwe construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and\nconduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our\nMMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to\nprovide compelling rationales to support its assessments.\n","authors":["Longzheng Wang","Xiaohan Xu","Lei Zhang","Jiarui Lu","Yongxiu Xu","Hongbo Xu","Chuang Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14171v1.pdf","comment":"10 pages, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14168v1","updated":"2024-03-21T06:43:59Z","published":"2024-03-21T06:43:59Z","title":"M$^3$AV: A Multimodal, Multigenre, and Multipurpose Audio-Visual\n  Academic Lecture Dataset","summary":"  Publishing open-source academic video recordings is an emergent and prevalent\napproach to sharing knowledge online.

In\nthis paper, we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge\nTransfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE)\nproduced by pretrained language models. Specifically, during the model training\nphase, our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature\nembeddings of corresponding training samples around them, enriching the\nsurrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase, by using\nthese LTE anchors, LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples, thereby\neffectively addressing the forgetting problem.

The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design\nof the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these\nmodels tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To\ntackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar\nto prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,\nwe propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which\nlargely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model\nperformance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their\nsimilarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned\ntokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned\ntokens to supplement their information.

A much\nmore efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving\nsignificant compute compared to re-training.

In this work, we show that a simple and\nscalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and\nreplay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully\nre-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by final loss and\nlanguage model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.

This approach can support multiple modalities and facilitate\ndiverse unimodal and multimodal abilities through modality collaboration. The\ntraining paradigm of mPLUG-Owl involves a two-stage method for aligning image\nand text, which learns visual knowledge with the assistance of LLM while\nmaintaining and even improving the generation abilities of LLM. In the first\nstage, the visual knowledge module and abstractor module are trained with a\nfrozen LLM module to align the image and text. In the second stage,\nlanguage-only and multi-modal supervised datasets are used to jointly fine-tune\na low-rank adaption (LoRA) module on LLM and the abstractor module by freezing\nthe visual knowledge module.

To overcome this challenge, we propose an\nautomatic evaluation paradigm tailored to assess the LLMs' capabilities in\ndelivering clinical services, e.g., disease diagnosis and treatment. The\nevaluation paradigm contains three basic elements: metric, data, and algorithm.\nSpecifically, inspired by professional clinical practice pathways, we formulate\na LLM-specific clinical pathway (LCP) to define the clinical capabilities that\na doctor agent should possess. Then, Standardized Patients (SPs) from the\nmedical education are introduced as the guideline for collecting medical data\nfor evaluation, which can well ensure the completeness of the evaluation\nprocedure. Leveraging these steps, we develop a multi-agent framework to\nsimulate the interactive environment between SPs and a doctor agent, which is\nequipped with a Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation (RAE) to determine whether the\nbehaviors of a doctor agent are in accordance with LCP. The above paradigm can\nbe extended to any similar clinical scenarios to automatically evaluate the\nLLMs' medical capabilities.

Previous research in this field often focuses on\ntraining agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which\ndiverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents\nhard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast\namounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an\nupsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review\nof the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective.

Many previous methods attempted to solve\nthis task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are\ntrained on limited household datasets with close-set objects. However, two key\nchallenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions\nthat demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a\nzero-shot manner. Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose\nOpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object\nNavigation. We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet\nthe user's demand. We then leverage the generalizability of large vision\nlanguage models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from\nthe scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM).

If a search service can recognize the facets of a user's query,\nit has the potential to offer users a much broader range of search results.\nPrevious studies can enhance facet prediction by leveraging retrieved documents\nand related queries obtained through a search engine. However, there are\nchallenges in extending it to other applications when a search engine operates\nas part of the model. First, search engines are constantly updated. Therefore,\nadditional information may change during training and test, which may reduce\nperformance. The second challenge is that public search engines cannot search\nfor internal documents. Therefore, a separate search system needs to be built\nto incorporate documents from private domains within the company. We propose\ntwo strategies that focus on a framework that can predict facets by taking only\nqueries as input without a search engine. The first strategy is multi-task\nlearning to predict SERP. By leveraging SERP as a target instead of a source,\nthe proposed model deeply understands queries without relying on external\nmodules.

Through this, the agent can quickly accelerate training and\nimprove its capacity to judge the quality of its actions by teaching it an\ninternal incentive system. In particular, we adapt techniques for random\nnetwork distillation and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to measure the\nfrequency of state visits and encourage exploration by using semantic\nsimilarity between utterances. Experimental results on MultiWOZ, a\nheterogeneous dataset, show that intrinsic motivation-based debate systems\noutperform policies that depend on extrinsic incentives. By adopting random\nnetwork distillation, for example, which is trained using semantic similarity\nbetween user-system dialogues, an astounding average success rate of 73% is\nachieved. This is a significant improvement over the baseline Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO), which has an average success rate of 60%. In addition,\nperformance indicators such as booking rates and completion rates show a 10%\nrise over the baseline.

However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL\ndo not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents\nin the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do\nnot interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a\ngoal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of\nthese subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution\nof plan steps, each using only single agent planning.

Unfortunately, many programming languages are\nlow-resource, lacking labeled samples for most tasks and often even lacking\nunlabeled samples. Therefore, users of low-resource languages (e.g., legacy or\nnew languages) miss out on the benefits of LLMs. Cross-lingual transfer uses\ndata from a source language to improve model performance on a target language.\nIt has been well-studied for natural languages, but has received little\nattention for programming languages.

A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty.

Position\nEmbedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window\nto a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their\nextrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context\nwindow. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We\ngeneralise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by\nordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby\novercoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific\nlengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond\nthe training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with\nimpressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be\nseamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such\nas LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference\nlatency.

Despite the leakage rate being\nthe origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the\noutput rate and detection rate. In this paper, we conduct an experimental\nsurvey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the\noutput rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and\nbenchmark data.

One commonly recognized factor for this\nphenomenon is the model's familiarity with the given prompt or instruction,\nwhich is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt\nwith the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible\nprompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara. Notably, MonoPara does not require any training and can\nmonotonically lower the perplexity of the paraphrased prompt or instruction,\nleading to improved performance of zero-shot LM prompting as evaluated on a\nwide selection of tasks.

Attempting to\ncomplement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on\nfine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across\ndifferent layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple\ntraining strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter\ntraining in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name\nit Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA,\nwhich applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and\nrandomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results\nshow that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or\neven full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA\nconsistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\\%$-$37\\%$ in terms of MT-Bench\nscores.

Edge attribution\npatching (EAP), gradient-based approximation to interventions, has emerged as a\nscalable but imperfect solution to this problem. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew method - EAP with integrated gradients (EAP-IG) - that aims to better\nmaintain a core property of circuits: faithfulness. A circuit is faithful if\nall model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's\nperformance on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits,\nrather than the full model. Our experiments demonstrate that circuits found\nusing EAP are less faithful than those found using EAP-IG, even though both\nhave high node overlap with circuits found previously using causal\ninterventions.

Recently, some attempts have been made to replace\nthe manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g.,\nneural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing\nand training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well\non new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel\napproach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA\noperators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM\nserve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a\nzero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further\ndesign an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version\nof decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO.

The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially\nenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.\nOn the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko\ndemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a\nstandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter\nmodel with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem\nmodel within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model\nvalidates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of\nPaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster\nthan using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream\ntask accuracy.\n","authors":["Aishwarya P S","Pranav Ajit Nair","Yashas Samaga","Toby Boyd","Sanjiv Kumar","Prateek Jain","Praneeth Netrapalli"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17599v1","updated":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","published":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","title":"Coimagining the Future of Voice Assistants with Cultural Sensitivity","summary":"  Voice assistants (VAs) are becoming a feature of our everyday life.

The segmentation ambiguity problem,\nwhich arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional\ndecoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on\nthese models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability\ndistribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably\nsecure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named\nSyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

We subjected ChatGPT\nand Vicuna to 12 of these experiments ranging from sounds to dialogue,\npreregistered and with 1000 runs (i.e., iterations) per experiment. ChatGPT and\nVicuna replicated the human pattern of language use in 10 and 7 out of the 12\nexperiments, respectively. The models associated unfamiliar words with\ndifferent meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently\nencountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures,\nattributed causality as a function of verb semantics, and accessed different\nmeanings and retrieved different words depending on an interlocutor's identity.\nIn addition, ChatGPT, but not Vicuna, nonliterally interpreted implausible\nsentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, drew reasonable\ninferences, and overlooked semantic fallacies in a sentence. Finally, unlike\nhumans, neither model preferred using shorter words to convey less informative\ncontent, nor did they use context to resolve syntactic ambiguities.

We evaluate our\nmethod on GSM8K, MATH and MultiArith datasets and demonstrate that our approach\nprovides a consistently better heuristic than vanilla majority voting -- the\npreviously best method to identify correct answers, by more than 12% on GSM8K.\nIn our experiments it improves results consistently across all datasets and LLM\nmodel sizes.

Although lexicon-based methods are simple to implement and\nfast to operate on textual data, they require considerable manual annotation\nefforts to create, maintain, and update the lexicons. These methods are also\nconsidered inferior to the deep learning-based approaches, such as transformer\nmodels, which have become dominant in various NLP tasks due to their remarkable\nperformance. However, transformers require extensive data and computational\nresources for both training and testing. Additionally, they involve significant\nprediction times, making them unsuitable for real-time production environments\nor systems with limited processing capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the\nadvantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models. We propose an\napproach that utilizes transformers and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\nfor explainability to learn financial lexicons. Our study presents four main\ncontributions. Firstly, we demonstrate that transformer-aided explainable\nlexicons can enhance the vocabulary coverage of the benchmark Loughran-McDonald\n(LM) lexicon, reducing the human involvement in annotating, maintaining, and\nupdating the lexicons. Secondly, we show that the resulting lexicon outperforms\nthe standard LM lexicon in SA of financial datasets. Thirdly, we illustrate\nthat the lexicon-based approach is significantly more efficient in terms of\nmodel speed and size compared to transformers. Lastly, the XLex approach is\ninherently more interpretable than transformer models as lexicon models rely on\npredefined rules, allowing for better insights into the results of SA and\nmaking the XLex approach a viable tool for financial decision-making.\n","authors":["Maryan Rizinski","Hristijan Peshov","Kostadin Mishev","Milos Jovanovik","Dimitar Trajanov"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03997v3.pdf","comment":"Published by IEEE Access DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349970 Link:\n  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380556"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105v1","updated":"2024-03-26T21:04:29Z","published":"2024-03-26T21:04:29Z","title":"Large Language Models for Education: A Survey and Outlook","summary":"  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought in a new era of\npossibilities in the realm of education.

Many current\nsolutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both\nitem-based and user-item collaborative signals. A common trend in these\napproaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating\nmodel complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is\nessential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse,\nrather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as\nClick-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task\nlearning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions. We apply\nitem-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and\nnegative pairs based on item metadata. Our approach allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by\nutilizing semantic information from text. It leads to more accurate, relevant,\nand diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start\nusers who have few interactions with items. We perform extensive experiments on\ntwo widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our\nfindings demonstrate that jointly training user-item interactions and\nitem-based signals using synopsis text is highly effective.

Inspired by the recent success of language\nfoundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal\nTrajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort\nof question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression\nmodels, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,\nwe consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first\ntransform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural\nlanguage space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are\nconverted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text\ninformation through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data\nare then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language\nmodel. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning\nhigh-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between\npedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We\nthen train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the\ntokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to\ncapture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.\nLastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of\nthe question-answer prompts.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage\nshallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the\nrepresentation ability.
